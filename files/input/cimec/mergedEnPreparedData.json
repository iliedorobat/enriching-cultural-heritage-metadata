In the year 2000 the museum was organised as a department of the Constanța Museum of History and Archaeology and moved to the current premises, that was set up until 2005."},"location":{"zipCode":"905400","access":"DN 2A, E 60 road","address":"Strada Revoluției nr. 27","county":"Constanța","locality":{"name":"Hârșova","code":"60810"},"geo":{"latitude":44.685919,"longitude":27.948227,"target":"Stradă"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Archaeology","main":"Archaeology"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000194_09.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Constanța County Council","partOf":"National History And Archaeology Museum"}},{"code":"51620000193","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1633\u0026-Muzeul-Oltului-si-al-Muresului-Superior-MIERCUREA-CIUC-Harghita","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Florina Ghinet"},"phone":["0266.317.726"],"web":["http://www.mncr.ro"],"director":"Valerii Kavruk","email":["mcr_hr@yahoo.com"],"timetable":["Tuesday - Saturday: 9:00 - 17:00","Sunday: 10:00 - 15:00","Monday: closed"]},"founded":"2004","name":"The Upper Olt And Mureș Rivers Museum","description":{"details":"The museum hosts temporary exhibitions.

Outlaw for seven years in Oltenia, he is the hero of several folk songs. He participated in the Revolution of 1821. The house was probably built by the cupbearer Costache Jianu, Iancu\u0027s father, at the end of the 18th century, being a construction with a ground floor, first floor and a cellar. The ground floor has a floor below ground level of about 20 centimeters and consists of three modestly sized rooms, probably a kitchen and food storage spaces, the main entrance having massive oak doors with iron hinges handmade by blacksmiths of the time. Upstairs are three living rooms and an enclosed glass porch that faces north, as does the main entrance to the house. The cellar is provided with battlements in the south wall and small windows, probably used in case of a siege. The monumental ensemble includes the house, the outbuildings of the house and the hut. After the reconstruction of the house, it became the memorial section \"Iancu Jianu\" of the Museum of Romanați Area, which was inaugurated on September 29, 1959. The house itself and the valuable pieces it contains in the inventory (inkwell and brush, flint pistols, shotgun, chimera, water, personal items, pieces of furniture and household items, photographs and documents of the Jianu family), convincingly illustrates the way of life and social unrest of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.","summary":"The permanent exhibition is located in four rooms with a total surface of 120 sq.m.

Timp îndelungat Direcția Generală a Telegrafelor și Poștelor a făcut demersuri pentru înființarea unui muzeu poștal, dar abia in jurul anul 1891 înființează unul, când renumitul arh. Grigore Cerchez, directorul general al Poștelor, construiește, în incinta parcului expozițional, un vechi han de poștă în care au fost expuse piese de istorie poștală și timbrele ale acestei Direcț;ii. Existența acestuia a fost însă de scurtă durată. În 1958 a existat o tentativă - din pacate, eșuată - de înființare a unui muzeu filatelic. În 2004 se acordă titulatura de muzeu de importanță națională Muzeului Național Filatelic. Acesta are sediul în imobilul aflat în administrarea Muzeului Național de Istorie a României. Clădirea concepută în stil neoclasic este realizată după planurile arh. Al. Săvulescu. Poșta centrală a orașului a funcționat aici până în anul 1970, când au început lucrările de renovare a clădirii și de amenajare a Muzeului Național de Istorie a României. Muzeul Național Filatelic permite vizitatorilor - în cele trei săli de expunere - să admire o parte din tezaurul Poștei Române. Sala George I. Lahovary este consacrată în întregime mărcii poștale românești. Într-un sistem modern de expunere se pot admira vestitele Cap de Bour emisiunea I - a, valorile de 27 și 54 de parale, urmate de frumoase piese din emisiunile Principatele Unite și Cuza. Deosebit de interesante sunt colile din emisiunile clasice litografiate (Carol I cu favoriți și barbă), din care unele sunt unicate pe plan mondial. Alte piese deosebite sunt colile duble de 300 de bucăți ale emisiunii Paris, cu diverse însemnări și adnotări ale tipografilor francezi. Se continuă prezentarea emisiunilor românesti pînă în anul 1962 și pentru perioada 1990 - 2002. Se poate aprecia că majoritatea timbrelor românesti expuse sunt piese unice deoarece sunt prezentate (până în 1956) sub formă de coli nedantelate. În general, acolo unde a fost posibil, au fost prezentate la aceeași emisiune, atât machetele (probele de artist), cât și eseurile (probele de tipar) și colile nedantelate care au stat la baza tipăririi ulterioare a seriei respective. Probele de artist (machetele) sunt opere de artă în sine, realizări grafice de excepție, deseori semnate de mari artiști. Matrițele (clișeele) originale cu care au fost imprimate diverse emisiuni se găsesc expuse în vitrinele sălii Lahovary. Se pot admira celebrele matrițe ale emisiunii I - a Cap de Bour (inclusiv valoarea neemisă), plăci litografice (piese absolut inedite) și diverse alte clișee de mărci gravate sau tipografiate, clișee de cadru sau de cifra valorii. Foarte interesante sunt și matrițele de realizare a filigranului (sitele de filigran). Sala Cezar Librecht, dedicată istoriei Poștei Române, cuprinde piese originale, replici și machete, toate ilustrând aspecte ale evoluției poștei timp de peste 100 de ani. Sunt expuse costume de surugii, goarne și efecte poștale, trăsuri de poștă, lăzi de valori, diverse tipărituri și altele. Evoluția filateliei este prezentată în sala Dimitrie C. Butculescu, aici se organizează diverse expoziții filatelice temporare. În cadrul expoziției permanente sunt expuse medaliile obținute de Poșta Româna la expoziții filatelice naționale sau internaționale, precum și diverse publicații și tipărituri filatelice (exemplu: revistei \"Filatelia\"). Deține bunuri culturale clasate în Tezaurul patrimoniului cultural național.","historic":"The idea of organizing a stamps museum it is not new. It dates from the last ten-year period of the 19th century, when there were some private tries of organizing this kind of museum. During the inter-war period, the Romanian Post has made the steps in order to found a museum, but those weren’t enough.   The General Department of Telegraph and Postal Services tried hard to establish a Postal Museum, but this was only achieved around 1891; the new museum was presented to the public at the general Exhibition of 1906, when the well-known architect Grigore Cerchez, general manager of the Post at the time, rebuilt an old postal inn on the Exhibition precincts and presented there various items of postal history and the stamps of the General Department of Telegraph and Postal Services. However, the museum was short-lived.   In 1958, on the occasion of Romanian Postal Mark centenary, the Minister Council emitted a decision of founding a philately museum, decision that unfortunately was not materialized.  According to the G.D.287/03.04.2004, it was decided to give the title of museum of national importance to the National Philately Museum.   The year 2004 marks the rebirth of this museum, by the will, determination, decision and efforts of the friends of philately and of the Post.  The inauguration took place on 1st October 2004, during the U.P.U. Congress in Bucharest.","summary":"The idea of organizing a stamps museum is not new.

Starting from this collection, a small museum was opened under the protection of the Museum of Sighetu Marmației which did not survive the harsh communist period of 1985-1989. The building becomes a relict and it was eventually given and most of the exhibits were lost. After the revolution the local community succeeded in re-opening the museum in 2001 and the building was renovated. The next step was completing the collections, restoring the old objects and buying or receiving new ones as donations. On the 1st December 2003 the Museum of History and Ethnography of Vișeu de Sus was opened for the public. The present building of the Museum belonged to a German family. It turned into a museum in 2003 by adding a new storey to it. On the ground floor there is a 40 sq.m. room dedicated to the History Department, offices and an exhibition room of 30 sq.m., as well as a storage room for the objects of the Museum. On the first floor there is a 70 sq.m. room dedicated to the Ethnography Department, a 20 sq.m. room for cult objects, a 20 sq.m. restoration laboratory, a 10 sq.m. office and a toilet, as well as a 30 sq.m. terrace for bigger objects on display. The History Department is hosted by one room where objects and pictures (reproductions of documents and photographs) are displayed in five show cases and nine glass panels presenting the local history. The exhibition includes: archaeological pieces (flint tools, axes and bronze bracelets, ceramic fragments from the Iron Age and Mediaeval Age); a quote from the Royal Diploma of King Ludovic I of Hungary from the 2nd of February 1365 attesting the existence of Cuhea domain and the two \"Vișaie\"; Roman, Polish, Austrian and Romanian coins; documents proving the existence of a German element in Vișeu - a fragment from the baptism register of Roman Catholic Church, where are attested the first births of German children (1790), a German travelling chest; documents of noble families from Vișeu and other villages; documents of the Great Union from the 1st December 1918 and pictures with local delegates that took part in the Assembly from Alba Iulia; images from the town and Vaser Valley in the period between the two World Wars; local personalities, cultural and religious life; images of ethnics from the town (pictures taken in the Orsk prison camp in the Ural mountains where 86 Germans from Vișeu were deported between 1945-1949). The Ethnography Department hosted in two rooms - In the first room the occupations of the local people are illustrated with old pictures and wooden objects: agriculture, shepherding, work in the woods, processing hemp and wool, popular art and pottery.

Starting from this collection, a small museum was opened under the protection of the Museum of Sighetu Marmației which did not survive the harsh communist period of 1985-1989. The building becomes a relict and it was eventually given and most of the exhibits were lost. After the revolution the local community succeeded in re-opening the museum in 2001 and the building was renovated. The next step was completing the collections, restoring the old objects and buying or receiving new ones as donations. On the 1st December 2003 the Museum of History and Ethnography of Vișeu de Sus was opened for the public.  The present building of the Museum belonged to a German family. It turned into a museum in 2003 by adding a new storey to it. On the ground floor there is a 40 sq.m. room dedicated to the History Department, offices and an exhibition room of 30 sq.m., as well as a storage room for the objects of the Museum. On the first floor there is a 70 sq.m. room dedicated to the Ethnography Department, a 20 sq.m. room for cult objects, a 20 sq.m. restoration laboratory, a 10 sq.m. office and a toilet, as well as a 30 sq.m. terrace for bigger objects on display. The History Department is hosted by one room where objects and pictures (reproductions of documents and photographs) are displayed in five show cases and nine glass panels presenting the local history. The exhibition includes: archaeological pieces (flint tools, axes and bronze bracelets, ceramic fragments from the Iron Age and Mediaeval Age); a quote from the Royal Diploma of King Ludovic I of Hungary from the 2nd of February 1365 attesting the existence of Cuhea domain and the two \"Vișaie\"; Roman, Polish, Austrian and Romanian coins; documents proving the existence of a German element in Vișeu - a fragment from the baptism register of Roman Catholic Church, where are attested the first births of German children (1790), a German travelling chest; documents of noble families from Vișeu and other villages; documents of the Great Union from the 1st December 1918 and pictures with local delegates that took part in the Assembly from Alba Iulia; images from the town and Vaser Valley in the period between the two World Wars; local personalities, cultural and religious life; images of ethnics from the town (pictures taken in the Orsk prison camp in the Ural mountains where 86 Germans from Vișeu were deported between 1945-1949).  The Ethnography Department hosted in two rooms - In the first room the occupations of the local people are illustrated with old pictures and wooden objects: agriculture, shepherding, work in the woods, processing hemp and wool, popular art and pottery. In a closed show case are presented elements of popular clothing of different peoples that have lived here. Among the exhibits on display we mention: for agriculture: flail, pick to cut the bramble, wooden ploughs, yoke, primitive mill, bee hive, comb for blueberry, etc, for sheep herding: wooden buckets to keep water and milk, ladles, meddles, milk measuring, churning stick, etc, for work in the woods: pictures of raft sailing on Vasser Valley, Viseu, Tisa, and Iza rivers pike axe, etc, for domestic objects and popular art objects on display are made of wood, such as: different size mugs, bowls, pots, spoons, salt keepers, pepper pots, flasks, dowry chest, pictures of old houses, etc, for processing hemp and wool: a very important craft in the area; here we have spinning machine, spindles, etc. In the display of popular clothing there are ten mannequins (man-woman, bride-groom, boy-girl, German men-German woman, Hungarian men-Hungarian woman) wearing popular costumes.

The Pitesti Penitentiary is known for the Pitesti Phenomenon or the Pitesti Experiment, a period of extreme violence between 1949 and 1951, where about 600 students were thrown by the Communists into the hell of physical, mental and spiritual torture in forms hard to describe. The Pitesti Prison Memorial has recently opened its permanent exhibition, after several years of research and planning, in which a small team attempted to highlight the history of the former Pitesti penitentiary. Thus, centered on the theme of the Pitesti Phenomenon, the exhibition presents to the visitor the context in which the generation that opposed communism was formed, but also the late dictatorship, in which the same generation was thrown with broken wings after years of detention. The building: Architect C. Duțulescu; modern, functional architecture built for the purpose of penitentiary. It was built between 1938 and 1941 at the edge of the Pitesti town, and in 1942 the first political prisoners, pupils imprisoned by the dictator Antonescu’s regime, were brought here. Between 1949 and 1951 the Pitesti phenomenon, one of the most violent forms of psychological and physical torture in the Communist camp, takes place at the Pitesti Prison. The building functions as a mixed prison - political prisoners and common law (women and men) until 1977, when the penitentiary is decommissioned. In the same year it was taken by the Argeș Industrial Construction Trust, and after 1990 the company was privatized, resulting in several private owners of the former prison building. The building has undergone a number of changes in interior partitioning over the years, following its transformation from the penitentiary into an office building. The first blocks have been built in the penitentiary area since the 1950s, and the building is currently in the center of a central district of Pitesti. It is historic monument, A grade.

Together with his wife, they began to gather old objects back to the 1980s by going through the houses of the villagers and asking them to donate old things that they had in households and that they no longer needed them. In 2005, master Dorin Ioan Ciocănel, through a gesture of great nobility, donated his entire collection of old objects to the Local Council of Răcășdia. Our current museum comprises several peasant objects, organized chronologically and structurally, in three rooms. The first room imitates the interior of a 19th century peasant house, including furnishings, household items, holiday banquets specific to the Banat plain area. In the second room, furnished and equipped with museum furniture, objects for field work, clothing, documents, badges, medals and many more are displayed on shelves and in show cases. In the third room, as well as in the access hall are exposed mainly the 166 paintings and sculptures in wood, metal and marble of the late master Gheorghe Roua from Vrăniuț, donated to our museum by his heirs, but also other old, interesting objects. In the lobby there is an exhibition of old musical instruments belonging to the Răcășdia fanfare. In recent years we have tried to complete the dowry of our museum by acquiring various objects that have been donated by the citizens of our commune. REPRESENTATIVE OBJECTS: - men\u0027s specific costume, consisting of trousers, shirt and waistcoat and female costume consisting of blouse, skirt and apron; - Men\u0027s waistcoat specific to the area; - photos, from the interwar period, representing local people from Răcășdia in their folk costume. The day when the photographer came for a family photo was considered an event of major importance in that household; - Household items for domestic use, or required in the field, such as: butter pot - BADANI; water storage vessel - BURI; small balance; pull, cup and glass for brandy - made of specially cultivated pumpkins; - old musical instruments, fanfare - music was a pleasant means of relaxation at the cultural meetings of that period. The Răcășdia band was founded in 1896; - writing instruments: pen and tablet; - wall clock with weights; - collection of badges and medals; - bottles for beer and gaseous water - the glass bottle is inscribed with the name of the locality and the patron who produced, during the interwar period, the gaseous water at Răcășdia; - wool-processing tools and machines - looming while keeping a blanket weaving; - tools and rotary machines - the wood lathe is still in very good shape; - wooden sculptures representing statues, paintings, various figures.

Romanian communism meant, apart from so many dramatic things that “big history” records, a daily attempt to create the “new man” from the first moments of each individual’s existence. This museum aims to record, through a number of exhibits from that period, precisely this “little history”. The permanent exhibition is the result of the effort made by the Iași National Museum of Romanian Literature to bring together and showcase exhibits from that era. Over the years various temporary exhibitions on this topic have been organised: “The Childhood of our Parents” and “The Museum of Daily Life in Communism” (2014), “Propaganda Matters 1.0” (2016). The concept and arrangement of the classroom belong to USLIP Iași, and the room dedicated to objects familiar to childhood in communism is based on exhibits donated by USLIP Iași, by the “Heritage for the Community” Association and by the Association for Cultural Hospitality."},"location":{"zipCode":"700045","address":"Strada Vasile Alecsandri nr. 6","county":"Iași","locality":{"name":"Iași"}},"collection":{"importance":"County","profile":{"general":"Memorials","main":"Memorial"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465068_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465068_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465068_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465068_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465068_05.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"IS-II-m-B-03704"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Iași County Council","partOf":"National Museum Of Romanian Literature"}},{"code":"69465067","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2081\u0026-Casa-Muzeelor.-Muzeul-Poezie(i)-IASI","contact":{"phone":["0232.213.210","0747.499.400"],"web":["https://www.muzeulliteraturiiiasi.ro/muzeul-poeziei/"],"director":"Lucian Dan Teodorovici","fax":["0232.410.340"],"email":["muzeul.literaturii@gmail.com"],"timetable":["Tuesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"]},"name":"House Of Museums.

In addition to the original works, called “picto-poems”, displayed on the walls, the museum includes a number of large-scale artistic installations: • The Poetsʼ Footsteps (in all rooms) - a work composed of pairs of shoes actually belonging to contemporary Romanian poets, displayed alongside the fictional footwear of classical poets or literary figures, creating together a circuit of “poetic steps” for the visitor. • Bottles for the Mind, Heart and Literature (the room on the right) - a piece of work created from a variety of bottles “filled with poetry”, each containing a poem written by hand and signed by a contemporary Romanian poet. • Letters to the Good Lord (the room in the middle) - the work includes ten personalized typewriters, each dedicated to a Romanian poet. • Haute couture / Haute culture (the room on the left) - the piece is a poetic “fashion show”, consisting of plastic mannequins dressed in “poetry”, that is in various costumes on which verses are painted. • Stones for my Temple (the room on the left) - the ensemble displays a number of stones of various shapes and colours, each being painted and representing a symbol and a word; their juxtaposition forms verses from contemporary poems. With these works, but also with the other works or installations present in the permanent exhibit, the artist Ion Barbu chose a unique, lively and spectacular way of drawing attention to Romanian poetry. He uses a modern language that, through the means specific to visual arts, constitutes in itself a poetic work whose images create words and whose words are transformed into images."},"location":{"zipCode":"700045","address":"Strada Vasile Alecsandri nr. 6","county":"Iași","locality":{"name":"Iași"}},"collection":{"importance":"County","profile":{"general":"Memorials","main":"Memorials"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465067_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465067_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465067_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465067_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465067_05.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"IS-II-m-B-03704"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Iași County Council","partOf":"National Museum Of Romanian Literature"}},{"code":"69465066","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2080\u0026-Casa-Muzeelor.-Muzeul-Teatrului-Evreiesc-in-Romania-IASI","contact":{"phone":["0232.213.210","0747.499.400"],"web":["https://www.muzeulliteraturiiiasi.ro/muzeul-teatrului-evreiesc-in-romania/"],"director":"Lucian Dan Teodorovici","fax":["0232.410.340"],"email":["muzeul.literaturii@gmail.com"],"timetable":["Tuesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"]},"name":"House Of Museums. The Museum Of The Jewish Theatre In Romania","description":{"details":"The Museum of Jewish Theatre in Romania - opened in Iași, the city where the first professional Yiddish language theatre in the world was founded in 1876 - aims to reconstruct important moments in the history of Jewish theatre and capitalize on the legacy of cultural institutions representative for it in Romania. Located on the ground floor of the House of Museums, it includes a permanent exhibition distributed over 11 rooms. The Abraham Goldfaden room illustrates, through a manuscript notebook, photographs and posters, the birth of Yiddish theatre in the world and the life of its founder, Abraham Goldfaden, considered the Father of Jewish Theatre. Two halls are dedicated to the beginnings of Jewish theatre (19th and 20th centuries) and contain posters and other original documents, which testify to the performances of Goldfadenʼs troupe around the country, in the period after the performances at the “Pomul Verde” Garden in Iași. The permanent exhibition continues with four rooms dedicated to the State Jewish Theatre of Iași (1949-1963), which contain advertising posters of the institutionʼs first years, a puppet show set, props, programmes, a costume workshop, models of the building demolished in 1963, and a gallery with photographs of the State Jewish Theatre of Iași company. The next two rooms are dedicated to the Barascheum Theatre, a Jewish variety theatre, active in Bucharest between 1941 and 1945. Here the visitors can find photos, a replica of a costume belonging to Sara Kanner, playbills and programmes. The room dedicated to the State Jewish Theatre of Bucharest reflects the history of this cultural institution, established on August 1, 1948, still operating today, with an uninterrupted activity since establishment. Props, photographs, posters, and a screen on which movies and filmed shows will be projected are the main features of this room. The last room is interactive, with the walls lined with posters of Jewish performances in Iași and Bucharest; here, children will be able to interact and engage in various theatre-related activities."},"location":{"zipCode":"700045","address":"Strada Vasile Alecsandri nr. 6","county":"Iași","locality":{"name":"Iași"}},"collection":{"importance":"County","profile":{"general":"Memorials","main":"Memorials"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465066_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465066_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465066_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465066_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/69465066_05.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"IS-II-m-B-03704"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Iași County Council","partOf":"National Museum Of Romanian Literature"}},{"code":"69465065","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2079\u0026-Casa-Muzeelor.-Muzeul-Pogromului-de-la-Iasi-IASI","contact":{"phone":["0232.213.210","0747.499.400"],"web":["https://www.muzeulliteraturiiiasi.ro/muzeul-pogromului-de-la-iasi/"],"director":"Lucian Dan Teodorovici","fax":["0232.410.340"],"email":["muzeul.literaturii@gmail.com"],"timetable":["Tuesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"]},"name":"House Of Museums. The Museum Of Iași Pogrom","description":{"details":"The Iași Pogrom Museum, organised by the “Elie Wiesel” National Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania, in collaboration with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was inaugurated in order to commemorate 80 years since the tragic events of 28-30 June 1941. The Iași Pogrom was an operation devised at the top of the Antonescu administration and put into practice by Romanian and German army units, with the participation of some of the civilians in the city. The anti-Semitic psychosis, deliberately fuelled by the civilian and military secret services, contributed decisively to the preparation of the Pogrom of June 29, 1941. The digging of mass graves in the Jewish cemetery in Păcurari, before the violent anti-Semitic outbreak, proves the planned nature of the assassination. The Prefecture, the Police Headquarters, echelons of the Romanian army and gendarmerie, the railway company regional office in Iași have contributed to the killing in cold blood of over 13,000 out of the total of 35,000 Jews living in Iași in those years. The Police Headquarters yard and the two death trains were the main places of extermination for the Jews of Iași. Of the 4,400 Jews aboard the two cargo trains, 2,590 died. The first train, travelling from Iași to Călărași, left on Monday, June 30, and after six and a half days on a convoluted route, it reached its destination. The second train, Iași - Podu Iloaiei, covered a distance of 20 kilometres in eight hours. There were no stops on this route, but the train moved so slowly that the escort often walked along the moving train. In October 2010, a team of historians, archaeologists and communicators from the “Elie Wiesel” Institute, armed with archival documents and the testimonies of locals, discovered a mass grave in the Vulturi Forest, in the village of Popricani, Iasi county. A total of 36 civilian victims were found and extracted: 12 children, nine women, 15 men aged between one and 80. An investigation was carried out by the Iași Military Prosecutorʼs Office in file 271 / P / 2010 and by the Military Prosecutorʼs Office attached to the Bucharest Military Court of Appeal in file 12 / P / 2014. In June 2019, another team found a second mass grave in an area close to the place where the first had been found.

The initiator of the project is the Kálnoky Foundation, in partnership with INTBAU Scandinavia. The gala hall is presented in the unique style of Europe, known exclusively from Transylvania - the late renaissance and early baroque (the transition period of the 17th - 18th centuries). One of the most beautiful rooms of the museum, \"Lady\u0027s House\", as it was called the residence of the counties, presents the daily life of a lady in the late Renaissance and early Baroque: delicate objects, glassware, a corner for embroidery and reading. The \"master\u0027s house\", by contrast, presents weapons from the fights with the Turks, Turkish carpets.

The exhibition space of the Romanian National Aviation Museum includes two hangar buildings and an open-air exhibition. Hangar 1 (Traian Vuia Hall) The basic exhibition presents the history of aeronautics from the beginning until 1959. In the spaces dedicated to the three pioneers of the Romanian aviation: Traian Vuia, Aurel Vlaicu and Henri Coanda, the Vuia plane no.1 is replicated, models of aircraft made by them, as well as objects and documents belonging to the engineer Aurel Vlaicu. The \"Air Force Virtue\" National Order, the first airline-specific order in the world, founded by King Charles II in 1930, is a representative element of the interwar period. The space for the Second World War is highlighted by the presentation of the IAR 80 aircraft, of personalities, uniforms, documents. The period after 1945 is highlighted by reaction hunting jets and radiolocation stations. In the passage that connects the two hangars, the atmosphere of a street from the interwar period is recreated and the manner in which the Romanian society and aviation have been interwoven is depicted. Hangar 2 The basic exhibition is dedicated to the 1960s and 1970s. The reactive airplanes shown are MiG type 17, 19 and 21, L-29.

Planul după care a fost construită această clădire este identic cu cel al Institutului de Zoologie din Napoli și a fost ridicat în jurul anului 1912. Înființat în 1859, ca o secție a Muzeului Ardelean, muzeul și-a sporit treptat zestrea, numărând în prezent peste 200.000 de piese. Un rol deosebit, l-a avut și Expediția Română Transafricană din 1971, la care au participat și cercetători clujeni și de pe urma căreia s-au putut face numeroase completări cu piese exotice originare africane. Muzeul Zoologic este format din mai multe colecții științifice de animale (colecția malacologică Biltz, colecția lepidopterologică Franzenau, colecția de izopode Radu etc.). Ca valoare științifică și după numărul de exemplare conservate, muzeul se situează pe locul al doilea, după Muzeul \"Gr. Antipa\", din București. Muzeul este împărțit în trei zone: expoziția propriu-zisă, ce cuprinde un număr mare de vertebrate și nevertebrate, expuse izolat sau în diorame și microdiorame care reproduc cadrul natural; colecțiile științifice, care cuprind peste 300.000 exemplare de animale (din care majoritatea sunt insecte), și care sunt accesibile doar specialiștilor; rezerva muzeului, a cărui material biologic este expus temporar sau se completează expoziția. Exponatele se prezintă sub mai multe forme de conservare împăiate, uscate, preparate în lichide conservante și schelete. Piesele expuse, sunt aranjate atât în ordine filogenetică, reflectând de la simplu la complex evoluția regnului animal, cât și sub formă de diorame, arătând în acest fel interrelațiile dintre speciile care formează lumea animală. Pe lângă speciile autohtone, o mare parte din exponate sunt din fauna exotică, cum este de exemplu, colecția de corali, scoica-de-perle (Meleagrina margaritifera), scorpionul african (Pandinus imperator), fluturele migrator Monarh (Danaus plexipus), o varietate întreagă de stele-de-mare, pești Dipnoi, peștele-electric african (Malapterurus electricus), mâna Sfântului Petru (Zeus Faber mauritanicus), șarpele sud-american surucucu (Lachesis atrox), o specie de șarpe marin (Pelamis bicolor), dropia-gulerată (Chlamydotis undulata), găinușa de deșert (Sierrapthes paradoxus), pasărea paradisului (Paradisea apoda), tucanul (Ramphasthos toco), cangurii (Protemnodon rufogrissea), ursulețul-spălător (Procyon lotor), girafa (Giraffa camelopardalis), mangusta (Herpestes ichneumon), grupul de feline mari (Felis leo, F. tigris, Panthera onca) și multe altele. De asemenea avem expuse și animale care reprezintă rarități, specii dispărute, sau endemisme, ca de exemplu nautilul (Nautilus sp.), relict din era primară, care se găsește doar in Oceanul Pacific, (Lymulus polyphemus) singura formă actuală din grupul demult dispărut al Trilobiților, asperetele (Romanychtis valsanicola), care se găsește doar în apele râului Vâlsan și câțiva afluenți, tuatara (Sphenonon punctatus) care trăiește în Noua Zeelandă și care este rudă cu reptilele preistorice, pasărea kiwi (Apterix oeweni) tot din Noua Zeelandă, porumbelul-evantai (Goura victoria) vulturul-bărbos (Gypaetus barbatus) și vulturul pleșuv (Aegypius monachus) ambele specii dispărute definitiv din fauna țării noastre, ornitorincul (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) și echidna (Zaglosus brujnei) din Australia. Aspectele comportamentale ale vieții animalelor sunt relevate în mai multe moduri. Spre exemplu, avem expuse insectare tematice în care sunt arătate variațiile de talie ale fluturilor în anotimpul ploios și secetos, aspecte de homocromie copiantă și mimetism la fluturi și larve și de asemenea etape ale elaborării firului de mătase la fluturele-de-mătase (Bombix mori). De asemenea, viața păsărilor de stufăriș, cu tipurile de cuiburi pe care acestea le construiesc, precum și diorama cu fauna câmpiei Bărăganului, alcătuiesc o zonă informațională sugestivă. Exemplarele de colibri, atrag atenția prin variația coloritului schimbător în funcție de lumina care cade pe corpul lor cât și prin felul cum se hrănesc. De un interes deosebit este și microdiorama în care se află expuși grangurii (Oriolus oriolus). Aici este prezentat atât fenomenul de dicromism sexual, precum și locul în care este construit cuibul și ponta. O dioramă deosebit de reprezentativă este și cea în care este arătată lupta pentru existență pe timp de iarnă într-o pădure din zona noastră, și care alcătuiește totodată un spațiu explicativ bine documentat. În ceea ce privește colecțiile științifice, acestea sunt depozitate în majoritate într-o sală. Mai există însă și colecții tematice expuse în sălile muzeului.","summary":"The Zoological Museum is situated down stairs of the Faculty of Biology building. The plans of the construction are identical to the ones of the Institute of Zoology from Naples, and were built around 1912. Made in 1859, as a department of the museum, the Zoological Museum of the University of Cluj, has gradually increased its collections, counting now over 200.000 pieces. A special role had the Cross-African Romanian Expedition in 1971, at which took part also researchers from Cluj. The result of this expedition was the increased number of animal species with enriched the dioramas that presents the animals in their own environment. The museum contains several scientific animal collections (Biltz malacological collections; Frantzenau lepidoptera collection; Radu isopoda collection). Judging by the scientific value and the number of species detained, the museum is situated on the second place, after \"Gr. Antipa\" Museum from Bucharest. The museum is organized in three areas: the main exhibition, which includes a large number of vertebrates, exposed isolated or in dioramas and microdioramas that look similar to their natural habitat; scientific collections, that contain over 300,000 animal exemplars (the majority being insects) and which are accessible only to specialists; and the museums reserve, used for completing the exhibition and exposed only temporary. The main exhibition is the one from the museum, accessible to the public and to biology students, and occupies almost all the space.  The exhibits are presented in more forms of conservation: stuffed, dried, put in conserving liquids, and skeletons. Exposed examples are arranged in philogenetical order to reflect the evolution of the animal reign but also in dioramas, thus showing the interrelationships between species that form the animal world.  Besides local species, a large part represents exotic fauna, like, for example, the coral collection, pearl shells (Meleagrina margaritifera), the African scorpion (Pandinus imperator), the migrating Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexipus), a large variety of sea stars, Dipnoi fish, the electric African fish (Malapterurus electricus); Saint Peter\u0027s hand fish (Zeus faber mauritanicus), the surucucu snake (Lachesis atrox), a sea snake specie (Pelamis bicolor), collared bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), the desert hen (Sierraptes paradoxus), the paradise bird (Paradisea apoda), the toucan (Ramphastos toco), the kangaroos (Protemnodon rufogrissea), the racoon (Procyon lotor), the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), the mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), big cats (Felis leo, Felis tigris, Panthera onça) and many others.  Also animals representing endemically rarities are exposed, extinct species, or endemics as nautilus (Nautilus sp.), primary era relic, which can be found only in the Pacific Ocean, (Lymulus polyphemus), the only present form of the long lost groups of trilobites, a fish called asprete (Romanychtis valsanicola), that is found only in the waters of Vâlsan river and some of its streams, tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), that lives in New Zeeland, and is related with the prehistoric reptiles, the kiwi bird (Apterix oeweni), also from New Zeeland, the fan-pigeon (Goura victoria), bearded eagle and the bald eagle (Aegypius monachus), both species being extinct from our country’s fauna, the platypus (Ornithorhychus anatinus) and the echidna (Zaglosus brujnei) from Australia. The behavioural aspects of animal life are revealed in more ways. For example in thematic insectariums are shown the size variations of butterflies through out the rain and the dry seasons, aspects of mimetic and protective coloration at butterflies and maggots and also stages in the development process of the silkworm (Bombix mori).  The diorama that shows the life of reed birds and their types of nests and also the diorama with the fauna of the Bărăgan plain, builds a suggestive informational zone. The same goes to the fly birds that capture attention by the change of colours when moving in the light and changing diet. A distinctive interest is also for the kangaroo diorama (Oriolus oriolus). In here being well presented the sexual different coloration as well as the way of choosing the spot were the nest is to be built. A great diorama is one in which the fight for existence during the winter period is presented in a forest, which is in the same time on a very well documented location. As for the scientific collections, they are deposited in a specially designed room for representing the results of a life-times work of some researchers part of them being former professors or students of the university. There are also some thematic collections exposed in the halls of the museum. But part of these collections does not have scientific documentation anymore due to the fact that two World Wars have passed over the museum.  A simple reminder of the most important would be appropriate."},"location":{"zipCode":"400006","access":"Buses: 9, 24, 29, 30; Trolleybuses: 1, 6, 7 (The Station Children Hospital)","address":"Strada Clinicilor nr. 5 - 7","county":"Cluj","locality":{"name":"Cluj-Napoca","code":"54984"},"geo":{"latitude":46.763989,"longitude":23.579971,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Natural Sciences","main":"Natural Sciences - Zoology"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_05.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Babeș-Bolyai University"}},{"code":"7300800","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d749\u0026-Muzeul-National-al-Hartilor-si-Cartii-Vechi-BUCURESTI","contact":{"phone":["0740.220.202"],"web":["http://www.muzeulhartilor.ro/"],"director":"Maria-Cristina Toma","fax":["021.230.52.84"],"email":["comunicare@muzeulhartilor.ro"],"timetable":["Wednesday-Sunday 10:00 - 18:00","Monday","Tuesday: closed"]},"founded":"2003","name":"National Museum Of Maps And Rare Books","description":{"details":"The exhibits include 667 maps, engravings, drawings, lithographs, as well as a series of artefacts specific of the museum themes.

Cotroceni Palace was meant to represent the residence of the Crown Prince and Princess of the Kingdom of Romania, Ferdinand and Mary. Here took place crucial political events of Romania: the Crown Council (14/17 August 1916) that decided Romania\u0027s participation in World War I; in December 1918 here were received the delegates from Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia who voiced their willingness to unite with Romania; in May 1918 here was signed the peace of Buftea-Bucharest; the Crown Council took place here in September 1939; Romanian and foreign personalities were received here. Cotroceni Palace was built between 1893 and 1895 by French architect Paul Gottreau. The palace was extended in the 20th century more times - mostly from 1900 to 1910 and from 1915 to 1925; in order to meet the demands of Queen Mary, several interiors were changed by architect Grigore Cerchez, who used the Neo-Romanian style. Between 1971 and 1986, the palace underwent a vast restoration, as large spaces were restored according to witnesses from the beginning of the century, while other interiors were refurbished following the pattern of the European princely residences from the 19th century. It all resulted in a variety of styles of the interior decoration. The most representative rooms are: the Hall of Honour, the Great Reception Salon, the apartment in a German Neo-Renaissance style, as well as the Henry II, Louis Quinze, Louis Seize, Rococo, Empire, Biedermeier and Art Nouveau apartments. The exhibits include Brancovan and post-Brancovan decorative art items in a mediaeval environment: the kitchen, the refectory, cells, the princely cellars (the 17th century), the church door frame. One can see the princely residence of Cotroceni comprising original items: furniture belonging to the royal family, interior textiles, paintings. At the same time, one can see tomb stones of the Cantacuzino family, ornaments, funerary objects, coins, Smaranda Cantacuzino\u0027s costume. The museum also includes an important book collection.

The Brancovan Palace of Mogoșoaia was first documented on the 24th of Aprilie 1698. The construction was completed on the 20 September 1702 (as the inscription above the main door reads). Stephen, son of Prince Constantine Brancovan lived in the palace. Set by the lakeside, in a rectangular courtyard surrounded by strong walls, the palace has a rectangular, regular plan, having three storeys: basement (cellar), ground floor and upper floor. The cellar is remarkable due to its sizes and solidness. A central pillar divides the space into four rooms, each covered by a cupola with pendants. The ground floor comprises eight rooms for the prince\u0027s servants, while the entire upper floor used to be inhabited by the princely family. At the upper storey, on the facade looking aut the lake, there is the most refined architectural element of the palace: the magnificent loggia, Venetian in style, with three arches. Nowadays it is framed by two turrets, added during the restoration from 1860 - 1880, that can be remarked due to their columns with capitals carved in stone. In addition, the turret on the east side of the palace stands on eight stone columns, with a richly decorated balustrade. The vault of the turret had been covered with mural painting with geometric and floral motifs, of which a few fragments are extant. On the upper floor, probably in the High Spatharus hall, there is a large fresco depicting, on two meter panels each, the travel of the prince to Adrianopolis, in 1703, and his encounter with the sultan. Fragments from this fresco were still extant by the middle of the 19th century, but most paintings, stuccos and interior decorations were destroyed by the Turks in 1775. The rich inlaid work mingles stylistic elements characteristic both of the Renaissance and the Baroque.

The European Art Gallery, Romanian Old Art Gallery, Romanian Modern Art Gallery sum up works displayed in an attractive modern manner, and any visit is a pleasant, interesting way to spend time. The history borne by the building makes the visit a travel in time, as on the place where the Kretzulescu wings stands today, the boyar Dinicu Golescu raised, between 1812 and 1820, a house of impressive size for the contemporaries. During the time of Alexandru Ioan Cuza the building turned into a princely lodging, and during the time of Charles I, a winter palace. The king adorned it after his taste and was also involved with developing a painting collection, today the core of the European Art Gallery. The palace underwent a stage of modifications during the time of Ferdinand and Charles II, and its changed in 1948, when it was decided to open here a museum of art and the reception halls of the central body were assigned to the State Council. During the events of December 1989, eighty per cent of the building was damaged, and over 1,000 works of art were deteriorated or destroyed. In 1990 the building in Revolution Square turned into the National Museum of Art of Romania. The European Art Gallery, sheltered in the Kretzulescu wing, reflects, due to the distribution of the 300 works, the main art schools of Europe between the 14th and 19th centuries. From the late Gothic and the Renaissance, continuing with Mannerism and Caravagism, up to the Baroque and Rococo patterns, Italian painting is represented by works of the masters Domenico Veneziano, Jacopo Bassano, Bronzino, Jacopo Tintoretto, Luca Giordano, Orazio Gentileschi, Jacopo Amigoni. The German art collection illustrates the German version of the international Gothic or the north Renaissance pattern due to remarkable works by Bartholomäus Zeitblom, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans von Aachen. Religious fervour and burning temperament characterize the Spanish paintings by El Greco, Francisco Zurbarán, Alonso Cano, Antonio Pereda. Realism, the mystery of the light and shade or the epic picturesque of the scenes can be found in the works of Flemish artists (Bartholomäus Spranger, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Pieter Paul Rubens, David Ryckaert III) and Dutch artists (Rembrandt Harmensz, Van Rijn, Jan Davidsz, De Heem). The French art halls are spanned by works from the 16th - 19th centuries. Important artists include: J.B. Oudry, Nicolas de Largillière, Gaspar Dughet, Joseph Parrocel, next to Claude Monet, Paul Signac, Alfred Sisley. The sculpture collection includes remarkable creations by Auguste Rodin, Antoine Bourdelle, Jules Dalou and Camille Claudel. The Romanian Old Art Gallery includes 900 pieces offering a unitary image upon the cultural life in the historical provinces: Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania from the 14th - 18th centuries. Remarkable are the fresco fragments (those from Curtea de Argeș [Argeș Court] - 1526) and the icons (Wailing the Lord) - the 15th 16th centuries, Saints Simeon and Sava - 1522 - 1523, both from the monastery of Curtea de Argeș, the Virgin with Child surrounded by prophets - the second half of the 16th century, Pangarati monastery), embroideries (Epitaphs of Cozia Monastery - 1395 -1396 and of Neamt Monastery - 1437, the Air of \"St. Nicholas of Rădăuți\" Church - about 1493, the Stoles of Tismana Monastery - early 16th century), manuscripts (the Four Gospels, achieved in a Byzantine workshop, whose text dates from the 12th century, the Four Gospels of Gavril Uric - 1436 - 1437, the Four Gospels of monk Dimitrie Gramaticul - 1512), gold and silver items (the censer from Tismana - 1508-1512, the shrine from Hurezi - 1691 -1692, the precious metal vessel with artistic incrustations from Precista Monastery in Bacău - 1491 - 1496, the procession cross from Slatina Monastery - 1558), wooden and stone sculptures (the imperial doors from the church in Cârligul (Bacău) - early 16th century, the rib with the coats of arms of Moldavia from \"Three Hierachs\" in Jassy, 1637 - 1638). The gallery includes a Treasure to which three halls are dedicated, where one can see secular and religious items out of precious metals and stones, jewels and costume accessories from the 14th - 19th centuries. The Romanian Modern Art Gallery reconstructs due to the 700 paintings and sculptures the path of Romanian art from early 19th century - illustrated by the departure from the religious art of Byzantine inspiration - to the age of the great classics of Romanian art. The two centuries of art, revealed by numerous artistic trends and tendencies, are represented both by famous names, relevant for the entire Romanian culture, and by less known outstanding artists included for the first time in the permanent exhibition of the National Gallery. The tradition of portraits and the formalism of the \"painters of thin\" are illustrated in the Gallery by the works of Anton Chladek, Giovanni Schiavoni, Iosef August Schoefft, while Theodor Aman\u0027 and Gheorghe Tattarescu\u0027s paintings show how these two artists gave Romanian painting a new interpretation of academicism and neoclassicism. Outstanding personalities of national art like Nicolae Grigorescu, Ioan Andreescu, Ștefan Luchian, Nicolae Tonitza, Theodor Pallady, Gheorghe Petrașcu, Constantin Brâncuși, Dimitrie Paciurea, Corneliu Baba, Alexandru Ciucurencu, Ion Țuculescu, many other artists complete the general configuration of the represented period, including: Iosif Iser, Camil Ressu, Francisc Sirato, Ștefan Dumitrescu, Ion Jalea, Jean Al. Steriadi, Nicolae Darascu, Samuel Mützner, Petre Iorgulescu Yor, Dimitrie Gheață, Rudolf Schweitzer-Cumpăna, Lucian Grigorescu, etc. The constant tendency of Romanian culture to intertwine with European trends is revealed in the Romanian modern art exhibition by the vanguard works of Victor Brauner, Marcel Iancu, Hans Mattis-Teutsch, M. H. Maxy, Arthur Segal. One of the halls of the gallery is dedicated exclusively to the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși and gathers youth and maturity works, such as: Ordeal, Child\u0027s Head, Sleep, Prometheus, Prayer, Danaid, Silence of the Earth.","historic":"Founded under the name of ethnography museum of national art, decorative and industrial art; it was reorganized in the present building in 1953.","summary":"The National Museum of Art of Romania has three art galleries and a royal history.

Remarkable are the fresco fragments (those from Curtea de Argeș [Argeș Court] - 1526) and the icons (Wailing the Lord) - the 15th 16th centuries, Saints Simeon and Sava - 1522 - 1523, both from the monastery of Curtea de Argeș, the Virgin with Child surrounded by prophets - the second half of the 16th century, Pangarati monastery), embroideries (Epitaphs of Cozia Monastery - 1395 -1396 and of Neamt Monastery - 1437, the Air of \"St. Nicholas of Rădăuți\" Church - about 1493, the Stoles of Tismana Monastery - early 16th century), manuscripts (the Four Gospels, achieved in a Byzantine workshop, whose text dates from the 12th century, the Four Gospels of Gavril Uric - 1436 - 1437, the Four Gospels of monk Dimitrie Gramaticul - 1512), gold and silver items (the censer from Tismana - 1508-1512, the shrine from Hurezi - 1691 -1692, the precious metal vessel with artistic incrustations from Precista Monastery in Bacău - 1491 - 1496, the procession cross from Slatina Monastery - 1558), wooden and stone sculptures (the imperial doors from the church in Cârligul (Bacău) - early 16th century, the rib with the coats of arms of Moldavia from \"Three Hierachs\" in Jassy, 1637 - 1638). The gallery includes a Treasure to which three halls are dedicated, where one can see secular and religious items out of precious metals and stones, jewels and costume accessories from the 14th - 19th centuries. The Romanian Modern Art Gallery reconstructs due to the 700 paintings and sculptures the path of Romanian art from early 19th century - illustrated by the departure from the religious art of Byzantine inspiration - to the age of the great classics of Romanian art. The two centuries of art, revealed by numerous artistic trends and tendencies, are represented both by famous names, relevant for the entire Romanian culture, and by less known outstanding artists included for the first time in the permanent exhibition of the National Gallery. The tradition of portraits and the formalism of the \"painters of thin\" are illustrated in the Gallery by the works of Anton Chladek, Giovanni Schiavoni, Iosef August Schoefft, while Theodor Aman\u0027 and Gheorghe Tattarescu\u0027s paintings show how these two artists gave Romanian painting a new interpretation of academicism and neoclassicism. Outstanding personalities of national art like Nicolae Grigorescu, Ioan Andreescu, Ștefan Luchian, Nicolae Tonitza, Theodor Pallady, Gheorghe Petrașcu, Constantin Brâncuși, Dimitrie Paciurea, Corneliu Baba, Alexandru Ciucurencu, Ion Țuculescu, many other artists complete the general configuration of the represented period, including: Iosif Iser, Camil Ressu, Francisc Sirato, Ștefan Dumitrescu, Ion Jalea, Jean Al. Steriadi, Nicolae Darascu, Samuel Mützner, Petre Iorgulescu Yor, Dimitrie Gheață, Rudolf Schweitzer-Cumpăna, Lucian Grigorescu, etc. The constant tendency of Romanian culture to intertwine with European trends is revealed in the Romanian modern art exhibition by the vanguard works of Victor Brauner, Marcel Iancu, Hans Mattis-Teutsch, M. H. Maxy, Arthur Segal. One of the halls of the gallery is dedicated exclusively to the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși and gathers youth and maturity works, such as: Ordeal, Child\u0027s Head, Sleep, Prometheus, Prayer, Danaid, Silence of the Earth."},"accreditation":["O.M.C.C.","nr.","2058/07.02.2008","O.M.C.I.N.","nr.","2363/08.05.2019","Reacreditare"],"location":{"zipCode":"010063","address":"Calea Victoriei nr. 49 - 53, sector 1","county":"București","locality":{"name":"București","code":"179141"},"geo":{"latitude":44.439822,"longitude":26.095978,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"National","profile":{"general":"Arts","main":"Art"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_09.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_10.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_11.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"B-II-m-A-19856"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Ministry Of Culture","supervisorFor":[{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1664\u0026-Muzeul-Dr.-Ioan-si-Nicolae-Kalinderu-BUCURESTI","code":"7300209","name":"\"Dr. Ioan And Nicolae Kalinderu\" Museum"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d698\u0026-Muzeul-K.-H.-Zambaccian-BUCURESTI","code":"7300206","name":"The \"K.

The archaeological traces uncovered belong to the following historical periods: the Palaeolithic, Neolithic, the Transition Period from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, the Bronze Age, Hallstatt, Dacian La Tène, the Middle Ages."},"location":{"zipCode":"217030","access":"DN 67 Târgu-Jiu - Râmnicu Vâlcea (km 47)","commune":"Baia De Fier","county":"Gorj","locality":{"name":"Baia De Fier","code":"78720"},"administrative":"Baia De Fier","geo":{"latitude":45.192106,"longitude":23.753707,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Natural Sciences","main":"Natural Sciences - Caves"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7138200_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7138200_02.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Gorj County Council"}},{"code":"7138100","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d334\u0026-Muzeul-Satesc-ARCANI-Gorj","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Grigore Pupăză"},"timetable":["9:00 - 17:00"]},"founded":"1970","name":"Village Museum","description":{"details":"Collection of household artefacts, photographs, documents, icons, costumes, and mediaeval art items.","historic":"The museum was founded by the school teacher Grigore Pupăză.","summary":"Collection of household artefacts, photographs, documents, icons, costumes, and mediaeval art items."},"location":{"zipCode":"217025","commune":"Arcani","county":"Gorj","locality":{"name":"Arcani","code":"78677"},"administrative":"Arcani","geo":{"latitude":45.082921,"longitude":23.132101,"target":"Localitate"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Ethnography And Local History","main":"Ethnography And Local History"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7138100_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7138100_02.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Local Council"}},{"code":"7132400","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1805\u0026-Muzeul-memorial-Henri-Coanda-PERISOR-DOLJ","contact":{"phone":["0251.459.707","(pri.măr.ie)"],"fax":["0251.459.707","(pri.măr.ie)"],"timetable":["On demand"]},"founded":"2005","name":"\"Henri Coandă\" Exhibition","description":{"details":"The „Henri Coandă” exhibition is located in the ancient town hall building.

On the bed was a straw filled mattress, covered with a homespun blanket and pillows covered with pillow cases woven with red thread stacked on top of each other, sometimes all the way up to beam. Above the bed was a rod from which decorative scarves reserved for the girl’s dowry hung down. Next to the bed there was invariably a daybed used for sitting or sleeping. On top of the daybed, was which decorated with a floral design, we find a traditional type of cloth attesting to the housewife’s diligence. Above it was the hanger, painted with a floral motif, on top of which stone plates were set and from which glazed cups hung.  The vests and hats hung at the end of the bed on another hanger. In the left corner of the house was another bed, with a dresser next to it. Above it was a sideboard on which plates, bottles and glasses for everyday use were placed. In front of the dresser was a simple wooden table, with two feet stuck to the ground. Under the table, on a board, were the water jugs and cups used for drinking. On the door was a board with holes in it from which wooden spoons hung, and above it was a shelf also meant for the wares used in the house. There was usually a cradle present inside the traditional house as well as glass painted icons on the walls and seldom even a mirror."},"location":{"zipCode":"517585","access":"in the Kindergarden","address":"Strada Principală","commune":"Rădești","county":"Alba","locality":{"name":"Leorinț","code":"6565"},"administrative":"Rădești","geo":{"latitude":46.254645,"longitude":23.7274,"target":"Localitate"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Ethnography","main":"Ethnography"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111620_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111620_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111620_03.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Alba County Council","partOf":"National Museum Of Unificaton"}},{"code":"7111610","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1901\u0026-Expozitia-etnografica-PIANU-DE-JOS-Alba","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Trif Anuța"},"phone":["0258.761.111","0258.761.758","0762.386.099"],"web":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografica-pianu-de-jos/"],"timetable":["On demand"]},"founded":"2006","name":"Pianu De Jos Ethnographic Exhibition","description":{"details":"Located in Sebeș Valley, rich in historical monuments, churches near the golf course, the community movable heritage can be admired in the ethnographic exhibition.

The museum includes donations of original objects: minisection of archaeology and numismatics (with traces of prehistoric Cucuteni culture and coins from the treasures discovered in the area), minisection of documents and administrative documents related to the activity of the peasants sellers of kerosene, an ethnography minisection in which you find objects from the traditional household (the kitchen), but also related to the women\u0027s housework (the craft room), a minisection of religious objects and a church books, as well as a collection of wooden icons, the minisection of education (school textbooks at the end the 19th century and the beginning of the last century, donated especially by the Bibiri family in Cernu). The collection of the museum is complemented by an open-air section with objects reflecting the occupations of the peasants (carpentry, iron work, agricultural work, transport) and even a wagon with which they used to travel on their way through Moldova to sell fuel. Next to this section a traditional oil extraction installation, a hecna, as it is said in the area, was rebuilt. In the museum there are rare documents and objects: the plan for the dissolution of the Măgirești and Prăjești estates drawn up by the cadaster of the village in 1856, using the \"royal palm\" as a unit of measure; an antimis from 1844, from the church of the Arini Valley, a splendid miniature box for sharing soldiers on the front.

Cele mai numeroase construcții aflate în muzeul pomi-viticol în aer liber datează din secolele al XVIII-lea și al XIX-lea.","summary":"The museum has four departments: the Golescu family memorial house, set up in 1943, the pedagogical department (1962), the history department (1959) - reorganized in 1982, the ethnographic department of the Argeș county (1963) - reorganized in 1991, and the open air museum of fruit growing and vine growing (1966).  The Golescu Mansion, built in 1640, is a historic monument and it was restored between 1942 and 1943. In the Golescu Mansion there are on display memorial items: period furniture, personal belongings of the Golescu family, manuscripts; folk art: interiors, costumes, pottery. The open air department comprises folk architecture and technology, vinegrowing facilities.  Golescu mansion, located today on the territory of Ștefănești town, is the only secular fortified residence south of the Carpathians, representative for the period before the architecture of Brancoveanu style. Founded in 1640 by nobleman Leurdeanu Stroe, the mansion was destroyed by fire. In 1716 was restored and expanded in the late 18th century by Radu Golescu. The complex entered the cultural circuit 75 years ago, after a long process of restoration. Before the inauguration in 1943, the rooms were furnished with pieces donated by descendants of Golescu noble family. Also, original paintings of members of the family, painted by C. D. Rosenthal, were made available to the painter Nicolae Grant to be copied and then exposed the mansion. Important was the donation of Library \u0027I.I.C. Bratianu \u0027in Bucharest, which consisted of a large number of antique books, kept today in the museum. Access to the complex is through a fortified entrance pavilion, built of wooden wall at the bottom and the top, which served as a place for surveillance and security. It is said that Tudor Vladimirescu lived here between 18 and 21 May 1821 before being caught and killed in command of Alexander Ypsilanti. Right at the entrance, on the right, is the room of civic school, founded by the great Ban Radu Golescu in the early 19th century. The school, which taught the village children, functioned until 1821, and five years later was re-opened by Golescu as a secondary boarding school. This was the first modern school with tuition in Romanian and worked until 1830. In the former school both furniture and old books are exposed. From the epoch of Radu Golescu dates and a hospital of the poor, called \"infirmary\", located to the left of the entry into the museum complex. Another interesting building, which dates from the early 19th century, is the Turkish steam bath. The building has thick rectangular walls made of brick and mortar. The ceiling is built of brick vault and is provided with holes for ventilation. The main building, located in the center of the fortified enclosure, was built over a basement area of almost 250 square meters, with nearly a meter thick walls. One of the two rooms in the cellar has a \"vault\" where owners could take refuge in case of danger. The mansion has undergone over time, a number of changes and additions. The building, rectangular, was originally conceived with a single level dwelling, having raised floor about two meters above the ground and four slopes roof, made of shingle. Inside, the rooms are arranged around a central hall, equipped with a spiral staircase, wooden, giving access to the floor where was a ball room. The whole complex was restored in 2015-2016 and reopened to the public in summer 2016.  The museum of fruit growing and vine growing comprises three complementary sectors. The most important sector is that of peasant households brought from the main vine growing and fruit growing zones of the country, grouped under the form of a Romanian village figuring the country contour, and the chain of the national historical provinces. Each vinegrowing and fruit growing household incorporates both the home, and all the adjoining constructions and the specific tools. The second sector is made up of the facilities and tools characteristic of the main trades outside the households, such as: the pubs, the hill mansions etc. The third sector will be organized in a specially built pavilion, illustrating the history of the fruit growing and vinegrowing in Romania, from ancient times up to the present day, on the basis of the archaeological, numismatic, epigraphic, and historical documents evidence.

The well was built from beech beams with a trough next to it for the animals’ drinking water."},"location":{"zipCode":"517280","access":"village centre","address":"Strada Principală nr. 17","commune":"Fărău","county":"Alba","locality":{"name":"Fărău","code":"4311"},"administrative":"Fărău","geo":{"latitude":46.341269,"longitude":24.003582,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Ethnography","main":"Ethnography"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_09.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101620_10.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Alba County Council","partOf":"National Museum Of Unificaton"}},{"code":"7101610","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1890\u0026-Expozitia-Etnografica-DEAL-Alba","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Bașa Alexandru"},"phone":["0258.747.050","0258.747.312","0749.983.103"],"timetable":["On demand"]},"founded":"2006","name":"Deal Ethnographic Exhibition","description":{"details":"The exhibition tries to restore a traditional house interior: bed with pillows, above which icons are displayed, framed by towels or plates; near it we find the daybed, the table, the chairs, and nearby a scarf is displayed together with various pieces of folk costume.

As shown in the traditional home decor, a special place is held by the female traditional costume with two skirts, undershirt and petticoats. Made at first from homemade fabric, this type of garb has undergone some changes during its evolution because commercially purchased cloth was increasingly used (jolj, silk, cotton cloth), which in turn changed the decorative style of the costume. The male costume consisted of a long shirt with ornate collar worn over trousers, usually with a broad leather girdle, decorated with different motifs made by stamping. Summer pants were made of white cloth and the winter pants, or trousers, from white or gray rough homespun. For cold weather, both men and women wore sheepskin vests and rough homespun overcoats.

These were all produced by this household. Here one encounters the richest collection of folk costumes in the county (23 in total). A distinct element of this exhibition is the presence of women’s winter costumes specific to this area and these reflect a massive influence of city garb elements seamlessly integrated into the traditional costumes. Important moments of village life and especially the life of local people are captured in old photos. The hallway is the room housing the loom and all the objects necessary for homemade textiles: distaffs, pulleys, reels, shuttles, spindles. Here we find on display fabrics produced through the toil of long winter nights when the storytelling took place. Items made through this craft were used to make clothing, scarves, towels, tablecloths, carpets, rugs, bags. In traditional homes the clothes and other fabrics used in everyday life were hung on a horizontal pole suspended from the ceiling beam. The influence of the Hungarian ethnicity is present throughout the exhibition by means of traditional garb belonging to the two ethnic communities, Romanian and Hungarian. The pantry is the place where cooking utensils for everyday use are kept: pots, plates, mugs. Among the simple earthenware we find a few fine china objects, such as an “untieai\" (receptacle for holding butter), which presumably belonged to a noble family from the area. The “boacaz” is the annex where we find the clay bread oven and where the flour was sifted, the dough was kneaded and the bread was baked; the patellas lean against the mouth of the oven and next to them we find the sifting sieve, the kneading trough and the flour chest. Next to this we find the tool shed and the barn which attest to the traditional occupations, with displays related to activities such as agriculture (truss, plow), gathering and viticulture (implements for vine picking), wine preparation and storing (muzzle, barrel and gourd).","summary":"Within the house the furniture that fills the space is limited to a bed with nine pillows, a bench and a table, a chest of drawers and all the fabric that decorates the furniture items. These were all produced by this household. Here one encounters the richest collection of folk costumes in the county (23 in total). A distinct element of this exhibition is the presence of women’s winter costumes specific to this area and these reflect a massive influence of city garb elements seamlessly integrated into the traditional costumes. Important moments of village life and especially the life of local people are captured in old photos. The hallway is the room housing the loom and all the objects necessary for homemade textiles: distaffs, pulleys, reels, shuttles, spindles. Here we find on display fabrics produced through the toil of long winter nights when the storytelling took place. Items made through this craft were used to make clothing, scarves, towels, tablecloths, carpets, rugs, bags. In traditional homes the clothes and other fabrics used in everyday life were hung on a horizontal pole suspended from the ceiling beam. The influence of the Hungarian ethnicity is present throughout the exhibition by means of traditional garb belonging to the two ethnic communities, Romanian and Hungarian. The pantry is the place where cooking utensils for everyday use are kept: pots, plates, mugs.

Lipsa patrimoniului a făcut ca instituția să nu ființeze de sine stătător imediat după luarea hotărârii, primăria organizând, prin Direcția culturală, strângerea colecțiilor și căutarea unui sediu. Activitatea se intensifică după 1926. Donația lui D. A. Rosetti din iulie 1929 a constituit nucleul de bază al secției preistorice. În luna următoare muzeului i-a fost atribuit un spațiu în imobilul din Calea Moșilor 115, unde s-a organizat o expoziție cu materiale arheologice rezultate din săpături. În februarie 1930 muzeul primește Casa Moruzi, monument istoric, situată în Calea Victoriei 117, iar în 22 noiembrie 1931 este inaugurată expoziția muzeului. Dr. George Severeanu a fost timp de peste 8 ani director al Muzeului Municipal, sub îndrumarea lui muzeul cunoscând o remarcabilă dezvoltare. S-au înființat secții noi: numismatică, medalistică, documente, istoria breslelor, urbanistică, s-a dezvoltat secțiunea artistică. În iulie 1933 a luat ființă, pe lângă muzeu, Pinacoteca municipiului, adăpostită în casa amiralului Vasile Urseanu, din Bd. Lascăr Catargiu. Muzeul s-a preocupat de înregistrarea pe peliculă a caselor vechi, fiind deținătorul unei valoaroase colecții de fotografii. Patrimoniul muzeal a crescut prin cercetări de teren, donații și achiziții. În martie 1941, după mai multe peregrinări, muzeului i se atribuie casa Cesianu, din Calea Victoriei 151, unde a fost adus întregul patrimoniu. Consecințele războiului au fost resimțite din plin de muzeu, casa Cesianu fiind rechiziționată pentru spital, iar colecțiile împachetate și strânse în câteva camere. Piesele cele mai valoroase ale muzeului au fost evacuate, în 1944, în comuna Rasnic-Dolj, unde au rămas, parte din ele, până în octombrie 1948. După ce în 1948 muzeul va fi mutat temporar în localul Muzeului de Artă Națională din Șoseaua Kiseleff nr. 3, în 10 decembrie 1956 muzeului îi este atribuit Palatul Șuțu, iar pe 23 ianuarie 1959 are loc redeschiderea pentru public a Muzeului de Istorie a orașului București. Palatul Șuțu este monument istoric, datând din 1834, operă a arhitecților Johann Veit și Conrad Schwink, care au ridicat un palat în stil neogotic, cu patru turnulețe poligonale și cupolă, pe ruinele unor construcții mai vechi. Holul central a fost finisat în 1862 de artistul Karl Storck, care a deschis trei arcade, scara monumentală cu două brațe și a montat o uriașă oglindă de Murano pe peretele din față. După moartea primului proprietar, Costache Grigore Șuțu, palatul rămâne în posesia fiului acestuia, Grigore Șuțu (1819 - 1893). Clădirea a avut diferite destinații publice în prima jumătate a acestui secol. A fost restaurată între anii 1957 - 1958, redându-i-se în bună parte înfățișarea inițială. Colecția de arheologie cuprinde piese începând din paleolitic, neolitic, epoca bronzului (culturile Glina III și Tei), geto-dacice de la Fundeni, Snagov, Popești-Novaci, dealul Piscului. Cea mai mare parte a colecției datează din perioada medievală: vase ceramice, podoabe, tezaure monetare etc. Colecția de numismatică, medalistică și sigilografie: tezaure monetare otomane, austriece, rusești, sigilii evocând marile familii boierești Năsturel-Herescu, Lenș, Ghica, Balș, Paladi, medalii, plachete, insigne și decorații. Colecția de fotografii: peste 49.000 de fotografii, clișee pe sticlă, filme, incluzând primele imagini fotografice ale orașului București, executate în 1856 de Angerer, aspecte de la cercetările arheologice, lucrările de sistematizare ale orașului, clădiri, aspecte din viața orașului. Colecția de documente: hrisoave, cele mai vechi datând din 1488 - 1582, fondul Manuc (în limba armeană cu caractere turcești), documente medievale, moderne și contemporane. Colecția de hărți și planuri, cu aproape 1.000 de piese privitoare la istoria orașului București, la Peninsula Balcanică, cursul Dunării, precum și la unele moșii ale boierilor. Colecția de artă plastică este alcătuită din tablouri, desene, pietre funerare, steme. Colecția de stampe, gravuri și litografii conține imagini de localități din țară și de peste hotare, personalități, tipuri sociale, scene de luptă, târguri etc. Colecția de mobilier istoric și obiecte de uz casnic, colecția de arme, uniforme, steaguri, colecția de costume și obiecte textile (piese de îmbrăcăminte, eșantioane de țesături datând din secolele XVI - XIX, podoabe, covoare, perne, perdele, brâie, unele descoperite în cursul săpăturilor arheologice), colecția de obiecte de cult (icoane, tripticuri, cruci din secolele XVII - XIX), precum și o bibliotecă cu peste 45.000 de exemplare, din care aproape în întregime literatură privitoare la București.","historic":"The museum was founded following the decision of the city council of the Bucharest city hall from June 1921.

When the gates opened there were only ten animals, currently there are about 500 animals belonging to 120 species, both local and exotic fauna. Currently the garden is divided into five sectors: primates, herbivores, carnivores, the tropical Pavilion, the Lake. The primates’ Pavilion shelters the ten species of monkeys, representing the African primates: baboons with mantle (Papio hamadryas), baboons (Papio cynocephalus), cercophytecus, such as the savannah monkey Cercopythecus aethiops), the hussar monkey (Erytrocebus patas), as well as the magot (Macaca sylvanus). Asia is represented by various species of macaques, such as the common macaque (Macaca fascicularis), the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina)) and the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). At the moment South America is represented by only one species, namely apella (Cebus apella). In the hall there are tropical plants: banana tree, Washingtonia palmer, Phoenix, ficus, and small-sized exotic plants. The herbivore section is on the highest side of the garden and was built by enclosing a natural space. The night shelter of the animals renders the local folk architecture. In the Zoological Garden the carnivores include bears, prey birds and various small mammals belonging to this category of animals. The felines are sheltered in the lions’ Pavilion. Next to the lions’ pavilion, there are the cages for pumas, lynxes and wild cats. There we find the lions, leopards and jaguars. The facilities of the bears, that has functioned since 1986, shelters bears and wolves. This sector includes also prey birds. The tropical pavilion was established in 1983 and is divided into three subsections: the aquarium section, the parrots’ cages and the reptile section. The aquariums are 37 in number and present various fish of the exotic fauna. The amphibians and reptiles sum up about 11,000 species. In the reptile section the order of the crocodiles is represented by the cayman (Caiman crocodiles), that lives in Central and South America. Next to the crocodile pool there is a row of terrariums for constrictor snakes: rhe yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus), the tiger python (python molurus) and boa (Boa constrictor). There is also a collection of smaller snakes: the water snake (Natrix natrix), the cave rat snake (Elaphe taeniura), the common rat snake (Elaphe obsolete), and the common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula). There is another representative of the reptiles: the green iguana (Iguana iguana). In the central part of the building there are the cages of the exotic birds, represented mostly by parrots. We can come across the monk parakeet (Myopsittas monachus), the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), the rosella (Platycercus eximus), the red-rumped parrot (Psephotus haematonotus), and the budgie (Melopsittacus undulates). Opposite the cages of the birds there is a botanic garden with various exotic plants. The lake, artificially built over the years, has become a real biotop.

Parterul Turnului este alcătuit din piatră de râu cu pereți groși de 2,30 m, datează din secolul al XIV-lea. Primele nivele au ferestre mici și goluri de tragere înguste, la nivelul 3 console de zidărie spre Cetate și Orașul de jos, susținând etajele superioare evazate. Există rânduri de guri de tragere \u0026#238;ntre nivele 3 si 4. Turnul a fost afectat de incendiul din 1676 și a fost refăcut parțial, ca și acoperișul, de către meșteri de formație barocă - Veit Gruber, Philipp Bonge și Valentinus Zimmermann. În interior Turnul are câte două încăperi pe fiecare nivel, boltite sau tăvănite, cu accesul pe scări de piatră sau lemn. La 1648 se adaugă sferturile de oră la ceas de către Johan Kirschel din Königsberg, figurinele fiind refăcute în 1677, și reprezintă zilele săptămânii sub chipul zeilor antici și zeițele Păcii, Dreptății și Justției, doi îngerași Ziua și Noaptea, doi toboșari și călăul. Aceste figurine au fost restaurate între anii 1999 - 2001. Turnul a fost până în 1556 Primăria orașului, iar la sfârșitul secolului al XIX-lea a devenit muzeul de istorie al orașului Sighișoara. Muzeul de Istorie Sighișoara cuprinde următoarele categorii de colecții: arheologie (preistorie, daco-romană, migrații, medievală), farmacie și instrumentar medical, artă, mobilier, arta decorativă, intrumente muzicale, obiecte și unelte de breaslă, orologerie, etnografie: mobiler, unelte de uz gospodăresc, textile, ceramică, icoane pe lemn și pe sticlă; arme albe și arme de foc, numismatică.","summary":"The museum was organized in the Clock Tower, a historic monument from the 14th century, restored in the 16th century, and later, in 1678 and 1894.

Matei Corvin continuă după anul 1458 lucrările, insistând mai ales pe aspectul de înfrumusețare a construcției existente, astfel pătrunzând influențe renascentiste. Ultima etapă de construcție are loc între anii 1618-1624 când principele Transilvaniei Gabriel Bethlen realizează ultimele construcții de mare anvergură (turnul nou al porții și palatul baroc de pe latura de est - actualmente cu fațadă neogotică).

Noua destinație, după anul 1724, produce monumentului daune însemnate, printre care și două incendii, ultimul, cel din 1854 transformându-l într-o ruină, după care este abandonat până în 1868 când începe restaurarea care datează până în 1914.

The last construction stage took place between 1618 and 1624 when Prince Gabriel Bethlen of Transylvania conducted the last great constructions (the new tower of the gate and the Baroque palace on the east side - currently with a neo-Gothic façade). In 1724, the castle became the property of the Austrian treasury and stayed that way until 1880.

Despre soarta colecției adunate aici în perioada interbelică nu se știu prea multe. În 22 noiembrie 1943 s-a semnat actul de constituire a \"Muzeului orașului și județului Turda\" în prezența profesorilor Constantin Daicoviciu și Ion Berciu. Primăria pune la dispoziție pentru muzeu fosta Casă Culturală. În 1945 I.I. Russu va fi delegat pentru organizarea \"Muzeului Arheologic din Turda\u0026quot;, iar în 1947 - 1948 începe înjghebarea colecțiilor muzeului cu contribuția importantă a lui Ion Țigăra, primul director al instituției. Deschiderea muzeului va avea loc la 23 august 1951; la baza organizării lui au stat piesele de arheologie. \"Palatul voievodal\" de la Turda, care adăpostește muzeul, cunoscut și sub denumirile de: Casa Princiară, Conacul Princiar, Casa Bathory, este cea mai veche clădire medievală civilă din Turda. Monumentul poate fi datat la sfârșitul secolului al XVI-lea, dar are în componență și elemente mai vechi de factură gotică și renascentistă. Monumentul, renovat și refăcut de-a lungul anilor, își schimbă radical înfățișarea exterioară și interioară. Este vorba de renovările făcute după 1658, când clădirea a fost incendiată de trupele turco-tătare și după incendiul de la începutul secolului al XVIII-lea. Ultimele mari renovări atestate documentar s-au petrecut în anii 1818, 1886 - 1887, 1910 - 1913 și, începând cu anul 1951, în această clădire funcționează Muzeul de Istorie. Sunt conservate și valorificate expozițional piese de arheologie preistorică, colecția de ceramică romană: ceramică de import - terra sigillata și amfore, ceramică de proveniență locală - vase de uz comun, ceramică ștampilată, opaițe, teracote etc., statuete din bronz înfățișând diferite divinități, opaițe și sfeșnice din bronz, piese de echipament militar, arme și piese mărunte de bronz, monumente votive și funerare (stele, edicule, statui, lei, conuri de pin, sarcofage), elemente arhitectonice și materiale de construcție. Perioada medievală este ilustrată de tezaure monetare, piese de armură, convocatoare de breaslă, inscripții și unelte de minerit. Sala consacrată luptătorului memorandist dr. Ion Rațiu adăpostește documente, fotografii și fotocopii din epoca modernă. Colecția de etnografie: costume și piese componente ale costumului popular din zona Văii Arieșului, țesături, ceramică, icoane pe lemn și sticlă, piese de mobilier.","historic":"After the Commission for Historic Monuments was founded (1921), the Cultural House (Princely House) building was turned into a museum in 1925.

Clădirea a fost construită în anul 1860 de arhitectul Grigore Pongracz, iar proprietarul clădirii a fost baronul Naláczi Carol. Destinația inițială a fost aceea de Restaurant și Hotel ,,Lemnul Verde”, în perioada interbelică își schimbă denumirea în Restaurant și Hotel \"Europa\". După al doilea război mondial intră în proprietatea statului și își păstrează profilul cu noi denumiri: \"Drapelul Roșu\" și mai târziu \"Someșul\". În anul 1997 muzeul a fost evacuat din localul unde funcționa - Claustrul Mănăstirii Franciscane - și printr-o hotărâre a Consiliului Local Dej i se atribuie această clădire. În 1899 membrii \"Societății pentru literatură, istorie și etnografie a comitatului Solnoc-Dăbâca\" pun bazele unei colecții muzeale care cuprinde 3.791 piese de arheologie, artă, etnografie etc., pe lângă Liceul de Stat din Dej. În 1900, în urma unui control din partea Inspectoratului muzeelor, s-a dispus desființarea acesteia din cauza condițiilor necorespunzătoare de întreținere și funcționare. Până în 1904 materialele au fost transferate la Muzeul Ardelean din Cluj și la Muzeul de Belle-Arte din Budapesta. În 1925 Consiliul orașului a luat hotărârea de a pune bazele unui mic muzeu comunal, iar în 1932 este semnat \"Regulamentul Muzeului și Bibliotecii Orașului Dej\". La 8 septembrie 1940 orașul a fost invadat de horttyști, care au devastat muzeul, iar directorul Liviu Deac este forțat să se refugieze. La întoarcerea lui, în 1944, încearcă să recupereze resturile risipite ale muzeului, dar autoritățile kominterniste ard o parte din patrimoniul muzeistic și de carte veche. În 1952 - 1953 patrimoniul este mutat la parterul Prefecturii (în actualul edificiu al Primăriei). În 1968 muzeul ajunge de rang municipal și reușește să se extindă în clădirea vechii Primării, dar în 1974, în condiții de totală insecuritate, i se impune să se mute în alt spațiu, în demisolul igrasios al Claustrului franciscan. Colecția de artă plastică și decorativă cuprinde picturi și sculpturi realizate de studenții Institutului de Arte Plastice “Nicolae Grigorescu” din București, ele fiind donate muzeului în anul 1971, prin grija prof. univ. dr. Raoul Șorban. Colecția de arheologie cuprinde descoperiri arheologice realizate pe teritoriul municipiului Dej, dar și în împrejurimile orașului. Piesele descoperite pot fi clasificate în funcție de epoca cărora aparțin după cum urmează: preistorie - din această perioadă au fost descoperite și se află în muzeu mai multe piese litice (lame din silex, topoare din piatră cioplită sau șlefuită, dălți și răzuitoare din piatră, brăzdare de plug, greutăți din piatră, mojar și piuliță din piatră), fragmente de vase ceramice, greutăți din ceramică și alte ustensile din os sau corn. O categorie aparte o constituie resturile fosile ale unor mamuți: defense, molari și oase. Epoca bronzului este bine reprezentată în colecția muzeului și are în inventar diferite piese de bronz: topoare de diferite tipuri și mărimi, seceri, lame de cuțit, brățări simple sau spiralate, inele, verigi, vârfuri de lance, piese de harnașament și chiar material brut neprelucrat (cocă de bronz). Alte descoperiri din epoca bronzului costau din fragmente de vase din ceramică și greutăți din ceramică pentru războiul de țesut. Din perioada clasică (daco-romană) se păstrează în muzeu vase ceramice, urne funerare, obiecte și unelte din fier. Cele mai multe piese le reprezintă inscripțiile romane (altare votive sau funerare), fragmente arhitectonice, tuburi ceramice de aducțiunea apei, fragmente ceramice, opaițe, arme, monezi și alte obiecte. Toate aceste piese au fost descoperite în castrul roman de Cășeiu - Samum, aflat la 6 Km de Dej. Epoca prefeudală este mai slab reprezentată din cauza lipsei unei cercetări arheologice sistematice în zona Dejului. Totuși există descoperiri izolate importante, ar fi de amintit opaițul de bronz cu însemne creștine (crucea și porumbelul - simbolul Sfântului Duh), datat în secolul al IV-lea, acesta se află în colecția Muzeului Național de Istorie din București Colecția de istorie cuprinde mai multe categorii de obiecte muzeistice: steme și blazoane nobiliare sculptate în piatră, arme și echipament militar (săbii, iatagane, vârfuri de lance, halebarde, flinte, puști, pistoale, căști, lăzi de campanie etc.) din diferite perioade istorice, lăzi de breaslă, unelte ale meșterilor, steaguri, ștampile și convocatoare de breaslă, vase din ceramică, documente istorice originale sau fotocopiate, cărți vechi scrise în limba slavonă, latină, maghiară și germană. Colecția de știință și tehnică în cadrul muzeului există o secție destinată istoriei mineritului - exploatarea sării de la Ocna Dej. Aici pot fi văzute unelte medievale ale minerilor, o balanță veghe de cântărit sarea, o roabă din lemn pentru transportul sării, un scripete pentru urcat sarea la suprafață, lămpi ale minerilor cu petrol, machete ale unor utilaje contemporane, documente fotocopiate care atestă privilegiile primite de mineri de la regii și principii maghiari, imagini din salină. O secțiune bine reprezentată în cadrul muzeului o reprezintă colecția numismatică care numără peste 2.000 de monede, din perioade diferite (secolele XIV - XX). O descoperire aparte, aflată in muzeu, o reprezintă tezaurul monetar descoperit întâmplător la Nireș (în apropierea Dejului), format din 30 de monede de argint. Colecția iconografică este formată din icoane vechi pictate pe lemn din secolele XVIII - XIX. Ele redau reprezentări ale unor Sfinți, Iisus Hristos în diferite ipostaze, Fecioara Maria și alte scene biblice. În Galeria de artă, inaugurată la 4 martie 1972, se organizează expoziții temporare, în special de artă plastică contemporană.","historic":"In 1899 the members of the \"Society for Literature, History and Ethnography of the Solnoc - Dăbâca County\" laid the foundation of a museum collection comprising 3,791 pieces of achaeology, art, ethnography, etc. In 1900 it ceased to function as the maintenance and operation conditions were inadequate. Until 1904 the items were housed in the Cluj Transylvanian Museum and the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts. In 1925 the town council made the decision to found a small museum, and in 1932 they signed the \"Regulations for the Museum and Library of the Town of Dej\". In 1940 the town was invaded by Hungarian troops who devastated the museum, and the manager Liviu Deac was forced to flee. On his return in 1944 he tried to put together the scattered remains of the museum, but the communist authorities burned a part of the museum heritage and old books. In 1952-1953 the collection moved to the ground floor of the Prefecture (the present town hall). In 1968 the museum extended to the old town hall, but in 1974 it was forced to move to totally inadequate premises. The Art Gallery, inaugurated in 1972, displays works of fine arts on a temporary basis.","summary":"The Dej City Museum is located in a building in the historical centre of Dej City, situated in the main square - Bobâlna Square. The building was raised in 1860 by the architect Grigore Pongracz, and the owner of the building was the nobleman (Baron) Nalaczi Carol. Initially, the building was supposed to be the \"Green Wood\" Restaurant and Hotel, but during the interwar period the name of the building changed into \"Europe\" Restaurant and Hotel. After World War II the building became state property, and kept its profile, receiving new names, such as: \"Red Flag\" and later \"Someș\". In 1997 the museum was removed from the initial location - the Franciscan Monastery Clauster - and due to a decision of the Dej Local Council moved to the current building. The history of the museum was dramatic. In 1899 the members of the \"Society for Literature, History and Ethnography of the Solnoc-Dăbâca District\" lay the foundation for a museum collection comprising 3,791 archaeology, art and ethnography items at the State High School in Dej. In 1900, following a inspection from the Inspectorate for Museums, it ceased to function because of inadequate maintenance and operation conditions. Until 1904 the materials were transferred to the Transylvanian Museum in Cluj and to the Fine Arts Museum in Budapest. In 1925 the City Council took the decision to establish a small communal, and in 1932 the \"Dej City Museum and Library Regulations\" were signed. On the 8th of September 1940 the city was invaded by the Horthy troops, that stormed the museum, and the manager Liviu Deac was forced into refuge. Upon his return, in 1944, he tried to recover the remains spread in the museum, but the Komintern authorities burned a part of the museum and rare book heritage. Between 1952 and 1953 the heritage moved to the ground floor of the Prefecture (in the current City Hall). In 1968 the museum rose to the municipal rank and succeeded in extending to the building of the old City Hall, but in 1974, under unsafe conditions, it was forced into moving to another place, in the wet semi-basement of the Franciscan Clauster. The fine and decorative art collection includes paintings and sculptures carried out by the students of the \"Nicolae Grigorescu\" Institute for Fine Arts in Bucharest, as they were donated to the museum in 1971, due to Professor Raoul Șorban, Ph.D. The archaeology collection comprises archaeological finds achieved on the territory of Dej City, and nearby. Most artefacts include Roman inscriptions (votive and funerary altars), architectonic fragments, water feed pipes, pottery fragments, lamps, weapons, coins and other items. All these artefacts were uncovered in the Roman camp of Cășeiu - Samum, 6 km away from Dej. The history collection includes several categories of museum objects: coats of arms carved in stone, weaponry (swords, spear tips, arrows, rifles, pistols, helmets, campaigns chests, a.s.o.) from different historical periods, guild chests, tools, flags, stamps, pottery, original or copy historical documents, rare books written in the Slavonic, Latin, Hungarian and German languages. The science and technology collection includes a mining history department - salt mining at Ocna Dej. Here one can see mediaeval mining tools, a salt weighing tool, a wooden wheelbarrow for salt transport, a device for lifting the salt, miner oil lamps, contemporary machinery models, copy documents, proving the privileges received by miners from kings and Hungarian princes, a.s.o. A well represented department is represented by the numismatic collection counting over 2,000 coins, from various periods (the 14th - 20th centuries).

Această campanie s-a finalizat cu formarea unei colecții de 1.230 de obiecte și 160 fotografii etnografice, colecție care a stat la baza recunoașterii oficiale a Muzeului Etnografic al Ardealului.

Înființat în anul 1951, muzeul a beneficiat, încă de la constituirea sa, de unele fonduri mai vechi: o mică parte din colecția de curiozități, orfevrărie, piese de mobilier și artă plastică europeană, provenind de la Muzeul Ardelean și mai ales colecția cunoscută sub numele \u0026quot;Pinacoteca Virgil Cioflec\". De numele lui Virgil Cioflec (1876 - 1948), autor al unor monografii de referință dedicate pictorilor Ștefan Luchian (1924) și Nicolae Grigorescu (1925), precum și al unor scrieri pertinente despre artă publicate în presa vremii, se leagă un act de cultură de mare însemnătate pentru viața Clujului interbelic: donarea colecției sale de artă românească, Universității Clujene (1929 - 1930). Deschiderea către public a pinacotecii Virgil Cioflec (1933) însemna, de fapt, deschiderea la Cluj a primului muzeu de artă românească modernă, al cărui succesor a devenit Muzeul Național de Artă Cluj. Alcătuită cu pasiunea și competența cunoscătorului capabil să prețuiască valorile consacrate (Nicolae Grigorescu, Ștefan Luchian, Dimitrie Paciurea) și să susțină cu clarviziune afirmarea talentelor autentice (Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu, Vasile Popescu, Jean Al. Steriadi, Lucian Grigorescu, Oscar Han, Cornel Medrea), Colecția Virgil Cioflec reprezintă și astăzi nucleul valoric al patrimoniului Muzeului Național de Artă Cluj. Amplificarea fondului muzeal s-a realizat în anii care au urmat înființării lui, pe seama unor transferuri, donații și achiziții. Operelor de artă transferate de către Ministerul Culturii, Muzeul Național de Artă București și Administrația locală (Barbu Iscovescu, Constantin David Rosenthal, Theodor Aman, Gheorghe Tattarescu, Gheorghe Panaitescu Bagdasare, Carol Popp de Szathmary, Ioan Andreescu, Karl Storck) li se adaugă un fond însemnat provenind de la Filiala Cluj a Academiei Române (1971). Cuprinzând piese importante de artă din Transilvania (pictori necunoscuți din secolele XVIII - XIX, Franz Neuhauser, Joseph Neuhauser, Franz Anton Bergman, Koreh Sigismund, Szathmari Gati Sandor, Simo Ferenc), acest fond a contribuit substanțial la conturarea unei fizionomii a patrimoniului. Spațiul de la etajul palatului este destinat Galeriei Naționale. În anul 1990, Galeria Națională a fost închisă pentru reorganizare, impusă atât de starea avansată de degradare a edificiului, cât și de nevoia de a organiza expunerea permanentă în funcție de noile cercetări și de piesele achiziționate sau donate în ultimul timp. Galeria Națională, redeschisă pentru public în luna ianuarie 1996 propune o sinteză de patru secole de artă românească cu un accent firesc pe fenomenul artistic din Transilvania: Altarul de la Jimbor (secolul al XVI-lea), pictură Biedermeier, artă stil 1900, avangarda, artiștii legați de Școala Superioară de Arte Frumoase și de Centrul Artistic Cluj: Alexandru Popp, Szolnay Sandor, Pericle Capidan, Catul Bogdan, Aurel Ciupe, Romul Ladea, Petre Abrudan, Tasso Marchini, Alexandru Mohy, Szervatius Jeno, Theodor Harsia, Kovaks Zoltan, Nagy Albert, Anton Lazăr, Virgil Fulicea, Constantin Dinu Ilea, Ioan Sima, Egon Mark Lovith.","summary":"The museum is housed in an important Baroque building from the 18th century, Banffy Palace, a historic monument, designed by the German architect Johann Eberhard Blaumann, and possesses an extremely precious heritage of Romanian and European art: paintings, graphics, and decorative art (the 15th - 20th centuries). Founded in 1951, from the very beginning the museum benefited from earlier collections: a small part of the curiosities collections, silverware, pieces of furniture and European fine arts, coming from the Transylvanian Museum, and above all the collection known under the name of \"Virgil Cioflec Picture Gallery\". Virgil Cioflec (1876 - 1948) donated his Romanian art collection to the University of Cluj (1929 - 1930). The opening to the public of the Virgil Cioflec picture gallery (1933) meant the opening in Cluj of the first modern Romanian art museum whose successor became the Cluj National Art Museum.  Created with the passion and competence of the connoisseur who can appreciate consecrated values (Nicolae Grigorescu, Ștefan Luchian, Dimitrie Paciurea), and support open-mindedly authentic talents (Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu, Vasile Popescu, Jean Al. Steriadi, Lucian Grigorescu, Oscar Han, Cornel Medrea), the Virgil Cioflec Collection also nowadays stands for the relevant core of the Cluj National Art Museum heritage. The museum collections enriched in the following years as transfers, donations, and acquisitions poured in. The works of art transferred by the Ministry of Culture, the Bucharest National Art Museum, and the local Administration (Barbu Iscovescu, Constantin David Rosenthal, Theodor Aman, Gheorghe Tattarescu, Gheorghe Panaitescu Bagdasare, Carol Popp de Szathmáry, Ioan Andreescu, Karl Storck) were completed by a significant collection coming from the Cluj Subsidiary of the Romanian Academy (1971). This collection made a strong impact on the heritage as it comprises important works of art from Transylvania (unknown painters from the 18th - 19th centuries, Franz Neuhauser, Joseph Neuhauser, Franz Anton Bergman, Koreh Sigismund, Szathmari Gati Sandor, Simo Ferenc). The upper floor halls display the National Gallery. In 1990, the National Gallery was closed to be reorganized. It reopened in 1996, presenting a four-century synthesis of Romanian art with an emphasis on the artistic phenomenon in Transylvania: the Altar of Jimbor (the 16th century), Biedermeier paintings, 1900 style art, the avant-garde, the artists pertaining to the Higher School of Fine Arts and the Cluj Artistic Centre: Alexandru Popp, Szolnay Sandor, Pericle Capidan, Catul Bogdan, Aurel Ciupe, Romul Ladea, Petre Abrudan, Tasso Marchini, Alexandru Mohy, Szervatius Jeno, Theodor Harsia, Kovaks Zoltan, Nagy Albert, Anton Lazăr, Virgil Fulicea, Constantin Dinu Ilea, Ioan Sima, and Egon Mark Lovith.

In 1928 it was restored by the Câmpulung architect Dumitru Ionescu Berechet, who got his doctorate in architecture with this paper, which won the Official Salon award. In 1948 the building was donated to the Romanian Academy with a view to becoming a museum, and in 1952 the Câmpulung County Museum was reorganized here. In 1977 it became the department of ethnography and folk art. The building houses valuable collections of pottery, folk costumes, and fabrics. On the ground floor we can find a homestead kitchen looking like a canvas by Nicolae Grigorescu and Ștefan Luchian; the “small house” or drawing room endowed with spinning and weaving artifacts, and next to it the “large house” or guest house. On the upper floor the exhibits include pottery artifacts reminding of the Câmpulung potter’s art of yore, a gorgeous pyrographed furniture, and an enchanting Muscel costume parade."},"location":{"zipCode":"115100","access":"near the Town Hospital","address":"Strada Republicii nr. 5","county":"Argeș","locality":{"name":"Câmpulung","code":"13506"},"geo":{"latitude":45.266167,"longitude":25.040762,"target":"Muzeu"}},"accreditation":["O.M.C.I.N.","nr.","2697/10.07.2019","Reacreditare"],"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Ethnography","main":"Ethnogaphy"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7004502_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7004502_02.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"AG-II-m-A-13578"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Câmpulung Muscel City Council","partOf":"Câmpulung City Museum"}},{"code":"7004500","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d89\u0026-Muzeul-Municipal-Campulung-CAMPULUNG-Arges","contact":{"phone":["0248.512.034"],"web":["http://muzeulcampulung.ro"],"director":"Alexandru Oprea","email":["office","@","muzeulcampulung.ro"],"timetable":["Tuesday - Sunday: 09:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"]},"founded":"1889","name":"Câmpulung City Museum","description":{"details":"The museum presents history items, archaeology finds (\"cists\" from the Bronze Age.

A fost construită pe latura nordică a zidului de incintă, în stil gotic transilvănean, fiind alcătuită din Turnul Porții, datând din secolul al XIV-lea, și un edificiu adosat laturii sale vestice, pe axa EV, din secolele XVI - XVII. Construit inițial pentru prelații Bisericii romano-catolice, în 1538 este menționat drept castel de către un proprietar cu preocupări militare. În 1556 ajunge în proprietatea principilor transilvăneni, împreună cu restul domeniilor capitlului Bisericii catolice. Între 1613 - 1629 a aparținut principelui Gabriel Bethlen. În funcție de aceste stăpâniri, edificiul a fost denumit Castelul/Palatul Princiar sau Castelul/Casa Bethlen. Mai târziu va purta denumirea de Casa Nobililor. De-a lungul timpului, clădirea a cunoscut mai multe modificări la acoperiș, la ancadramentele ușilor și deschiderile ferestrelor, mai ales în secolele XVII - XVIII, dar și XIX. În jurul anului 1940 edificiului i-au fost alipite câteva anexe. Clădirea a beneficiat doar de câteva reparații, în urmă cu peste două decenii. Sunt expuse piese de istorie veche și arheologie datând din neolitic până în evul mediu timpuriu: depozite de bronzuri hallstattiene (Cetea, Crizbav, Aiud, Zagon, Șpălnaca I și II), piese scitice și celtice, coiful militar roman de bronz de la Lunca Mureșului, monumente romane epigrafice și sculpturale, obiecte din villa rustica de la Aiudul de Sus. Ca instituție de cultură specifică, muzeul a luat ființă în 1796 sub denumirea de RARITATVM ET RERVM NATVRALIVM MVSEVM, pe lângă Colegiul Academic Reformat Bethlen. Inițial, valorile din domeniul istoriei au fost încadrate în grupa \"rarităților\", împreună cu anumite piese din domeniul științelor naturale. Abia în 1862, prof. Szathmary Karoly organizează prima colecție de antichități, inclusiv obiecte din epoci mai recente. În 1822 ia ființă o colecție numismatică, care în 1863 va fi completată și cu o colecție de monede și medalii a grofului Miko Imre. La dezvoltarea colecțiilor au contribuit substanțial prof. Herepey Karoly - custode al colecției de antichități între 1881 - 1896, ca și Fenichel Samuel - fost angajat al Muzeului de Antichități din București, dar și explorator al Noii Guinee și cercetător al vieții papuașilor. Prin Hotărâre de Guvern, în 1950 muzeul a fost separat de școală, fiind transformat în două instituții de cultură distincte: Muzeul de Istorie și Muzeul de Științele Naturii.","historic":"As a specific cultural institution, the museum was founded in 1796 under the name of RARITAVM ET RERVM NATVRALIVM MVSEVM, by the Bethlen Reformed Academic College.

It was built in Transylvanian Gothic style on the northern side of the precincts wall, being made up of the Gate Tower (from the 14th century), and a building on the west wing, on the east-west axis, from the 15th - 16th centuries. Initially built for the Roman-Catholic Church prelates, the building is referred to as castle in 1538. In 1556, it becomes the property of the Transylvanian princes along with the rest of the domains of the Catholic Church. Between 1613 and 1629, it belonged to Prince Gabriel Bethlen. Depending on these various owners, the building bore the names of the Princely Castle/ Palace or the Bethlen Castle/ Residence. Later it will be named the Noblemen\u0027s House. Over the centuries several modifications of the roof, doors and windows were undertaken, especially during the 17th - 18th centuries, but also in the 19th century. By 1940, a number of annexes were added to the edifice. Two decades ago the building of the museum underwent a few repairs.

The history and archaeology collections include ancient history and archaeology finds from the Neolithic to the Early Middle Ages: Hallstatt bronze deposits (Cetatea, Crizbav, Zagon, Șpălnaca I and II), Scythian and Celtic artefacts, Roman bronze helmet discovered at Lunca Mureșului, Roman epigraphic and sculptural monuments, artefacts from the rustic villa of Aiudul de Sus, and others."},"location":{"zipCode":"515200","access":"Right side of the main entrance in the Citadel.","address":"Piața Consiliul Europei nr. 24","county":"Alba","locality":{"name":"Aiud","code":"1222"},"geo":{"latitude":46.310163,"longitude":23.717435,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"History","main":"History"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_09.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_10.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_11.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_12.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_13.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7000200_14.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"AB-II-m-A-00172.01","description":"The building is part of the Cetatea Aiudului medieval architectural complex situated in the central area of the town precincts.

Initially built for the Roman-Catholic Church prelates, the building is referred to as castle in 1538 by an owner who had serious military preoccupations. In 1588 it becomes the property of the Transylvan princes along with the rest of the domains of the Catholic Church. Between 1613-1629 it belonged to Prince Gabriel Bethlen. Depending on these various owners, the building bore the names of the Princely Castle/Palace or the Bethlen Castle/Residence. Later it would be named the Noblemen\u0027s House. Over the centuries several modifications of the roof, doors and windows were undertaken, especially during the 17th-18th centuries, but also in the 19th century. By 1940, a number of dependencies were added to the edifice. Two decades ago the entire building underwent a few repairs."},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Aiud City Council"}},{"code":"6981520","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2086\u0026-Muzeul-Tarii-Vrancei-Vidra-Vrancea","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Maria Nica","position":"Secretară"},"phone":["0237.222.890"],"director":"Romeo Valentin Muscă","fax":["0237.222.890"],"email":["office@muzeulvrancei.ro"],"timetable":["Wednesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00"]},"name":"The Museum Of Vrancea County","description":{"details":"The Museum of Vrancea Country is the first local museum in a resilience project through which the Vrancea Museum highlights the history, culture and tradition of the main ethnographic and historical areas in Vrancea County.

The organizers of this open air museum took into account a few basic factors of a true village - the forms of relief of the area, fireplace and its border with all its elements - depending on where the community homesteads and constructions moved from various localities of the Vâlcea county were placed. Currently, the museum is representative due to its four sectors: 1.The Homestead Sector - the dwelling comprises 42 units and over 12,000 museum artefacts, illustrating the homestead structure, according to the traditional trades: agriculture, fruit-growing, vinegrowing, animal breeding or a series of folk crafts and techniques; the diversity and planimetric and volumetric evolution of the dwellings with one or more rooms are emphasized. The remarkable exhibits include the houses with pavilion in the Horezu ethnographic area (in the communes of Măldărești, Stoenești, Bărbătești), the homesteads specializing in winegrowing, moved from Drăgășani (the villages of Prundeni, Olteanca), in fruit growing (the communes of Alunu, Tomșani, Cernișoara) or in animal breeding in the mountainous regions (the villages of Boișoara, Pâscoaia-Brezoi). Next to the dwellings, several adjoining constructions were moved to the homesteads: barns, sheds, haylofts, coops for food storage or for breeding birds and animals. 2. The Social - Cultural Sector of the \"public utility monuments\" includes a rural primary school from the beginning of the 20th century, from Spiru Haret\u0027s time; an inn from the end of the 19th century from the village of Săliște, the commune of Mălaia; a wooden church, built in 1785 and moved from the commune of Nicolae Bălcescu; a swing from the commune of Stoenești, and in the future this sector will be completed with other architectonic sites. 3. The Folk Crafts - Techniques Sector presents the procedures and techniques for processing the raw matter necessary for manufacturing tools, vessels and various household items, the methods used for vegetal or animal fibre processing or the traditional techniques for obtaining animal and vegetal products. Several workshops were moved and reconstructed inside the museum: the pottery from the location of Vlădești (the 20th century); the joinery-carpentry workshop (the 20th century) from the village of Șerbănești, the commune of Sălătrucel; goat\u0027s hair processing workshop (early 20th century) from the village of Curtea, the commune of Popești; as well as a smithy from the commune of Prundeni.

The live fish collection comprises local prey and domestic species, from lakes, rivers or seas, as well as exotic species from the lakes or rivers of Latin America, South America (north part), South - West Asia, Central Africa (over 90 local specimens, 17 species and over 50 exotic specimens, 28 species)."},"location":{"zipCode":"820009","address":"Strada 14 Noiembrie nr. 1bis","county":"Tulcea","locality":{"name":"Tulcea","code":"159623"},"geo":{"latitude":45.180104,"longitude":28.805754,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"County","profile":{"general":"Natural Sciences","main":"Natural Sciences - Aquaria, Zoology"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975503_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975503_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975503_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975503_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975503_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975503_06.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"TL-II-m-B-05994"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Tulcea County Council","partOf":"Institute For Eco-Museum Researches \"Gavrilă Simion\""}},{"code":"6975502","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d625\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-TULCEA","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Iuliana Titov","position":"Șef Serviciu"},"phone":["0240.516.204"],"web":["http://www.icemtl.ro/"],"director":"Sorin Ailincăi","fax":["0240.513.231"],"socialMedia":["http://meaptulcea.wordpress.com/"],"email":["etno@icemtl.ro","relatiipublice@icemtl.ro"],"timetable":["Closed for restoration (since March 1st, 2019)"]},"founded":"1989","name":"Museum Of Ethnography And Folk Art","description":{"details":"Sediul Muzeului de Etnografie și Arta Populară (fostul sediu al Băncii Naționale a României - Agenția Tulcea) este unul dintre edificiile publice emblematice pentru Tulcea, constituind, împreună cu alte construcții, exemple valoroase ale arhitecturii de forme naționale. Construcția are la bază un proiect elaborat în 1924 și a fost ridicată în perioada interbelică (1924-1927), deci, la finele epocii de manifestare a curentului național în arhitectura României. Imobilul are o compoziție echilibrată generată și de poziționarea într-o intersecție, dar ș;i de funcționalitatea inițială. Acest edificiu public poate fi considerat un exemplar reușit al arhitecturii moderne, edificate pe valorile celei tradiționale, ce a marcat prima parte a secolului al XX-lea. Colecția de ștergare a Muzeului de Etnografie și Arta Populară este alcătuită din 2.385 piese ce aparțin diferitelor populații din această zonă. Prin funcția lor decorativă, ștergarele din Dobrogea se încadreaza în tipul de \"Ștergare de perete\". Același tip de stergar (local, \"peschir\"), de formă dreptunghiulară, îl întâlnim la români, bulgari, greci și ucraineni, dovadă a unui fenomen caracteristic zonei de conviețuire etnică. Realizat la războiul de țesut, din bumbac și borangic, ștergarul este decorat la capete cu motive alese, de asemenea, la războiul de țesut. Reprezentarea stilizată și geometrizantă, mai nerealistă, a motivelor cât și denumirile lor sugestive (\"unda apei\", \"morișca\", \"pomișorii\", \"coronița\", \"calul\"; \"calul și călăretul\", \"fetele\", \"steaua\") relevă o transfigurare artistică a naturii și a cotidianului. Ștergarele populației turcești și tătărăști sunt de forma dreptunghiulară (\"geaulac\") și de forma pătrată (\"cevre\"). Aceste piese erau utilizate cu rol decorativ doar în ceremonialul de nuntă și botez, în restul timpului fiind păstrate ca zestre. În ornamentica ștergarelor turcești și tătărăști distingem motive tipic orientale: \"panseaua\", \"zambila\", \"chiparosul\", \"floarea și fructul de rodie\", \"sacsaia\" etc. Motivele sunt brodate, în genere, cu fir de mătase, cu fir metalic auriu și argintiu. Colecția de ștergare cuprinde piese realizate atît la sfârșitul secolului al XIX-lea - începutul secolului al XX-lea, cât și piese de creație contemporană. În cadrul colecției de etnografie a Muzeului de Etnografie și Artă Populară, un număr de aproximativ 1.600 de piese reprezintă instrumentarul folosit în practicarea ocupațiilor și mesteșugurilor tradiționale, acestea reflectând adaptarea locuitorilor din zonă la un habitat cu totul deosebit în raport cu alte ținuturi. Gospodăria țărănească de la Enisala, conservata \"in situ\" este considerată un muzeu al satului dobrogean, prin colecția pe care o adăpostește și o oferă vizitatorului. În domeniul prelucrării produselor animale și vegetale în scop alimentar, colecția prezintă unelte, mijloace, dispozitive, instrumentar, arme, folosite la pescuit, apicultură, pomicultură, viticultură, prelucrarea semințelor, agricultură, morărit, creșterea animalelor, vânătoare. O serie de mijloace și tehnici reflectă preocuparea populației românești și de diferite alte etnii pentru prelucrarea materiilor prime în vederea obținerii unor materiale de construcție, a obiectelor de uz casnic, pentru confecționarea de unelte, scule, instrumente, dispozitive, arme și mijloace de transport, specifice activității în această zonă pentru civilizația preindustrială. Sunt reprezentate meștesuguri tradiționale ca: prelucrarea lemnului, a argilei, a pietrei, a vegetalelor (stuf, papură, paie). Pentru domeniul prelucrării pieilor, a blănurilor, a fibrelor vegetale și animale în vederea realizării pieselor de uz gospodăresc, a împletiturilor, a țesăturilor decorative sau necesare confecționării pieselor de port, colecția de etnografie ofera vizitatorilor o gamă largă de unelte, dispozitive, mecanisme, mijloace folosite în industria casnica : de cojocarie, curelărit, cizmarie, dărăcit, tors, urzit, țesut, cusut, împletit, melițat. Pentru ca toate aceste materiale, materii prime, prelucrate și uneltele folosite să fie transportate la locul activitătății s-au folosit mijloace de transport cu tracțiune manuală sau animală, pe uscat sau pe apă: roaba, căruța, cotiga, sanie, barcă. Un loc deosebit în cadrul patrimoniului etnografic al muzeului îl ocupă colecția vaselor de metal (267 piese). Colecția este diversă atît în ceea ce privește metalul folosit (aramă, fier, argint, plumb), cât și în ceea ce privește tehnica utilizată în confecționare și ornamentare (tăiere, perforare, ciocănire, laminare, lustruire, incizare, pilire, nituire, îndoire, turnare). În aliaje diferite cu zincul, staniul, argintul, arama are o diversitate mare în utilizarea ei: monede, arme, unelte, obiecte de podoabă, vase folosite frecvent în Peninsula Balcanică, deci și în Dobrogea, de diverse populații războinice, nomade, transhumante sau sedentare. Vasele de aramă, alamă, bronz, unele nichelate, alămite sau cositorite, se pot grupa astfel: căldare (bracaci sau bargaci, diminutiv bracacică), ulcior (ghium, diminutiv ghiumucic), ploscă, samovar, ceainic, fructieră, cafetieră, zaharniță, strecuratoare, cratiță (tingire), oala (cazan), lighean, cană, ibric, tavă (taval, tipsie, sinie, sofra), vase de cult creștin (cristelniță, aghiazmatar), vase de cult musulman (pentru spălat ritualic sau pentru ars mirodenii), alambicuri, prăjitor și râșnită cafea. Acestea sunt piese comune tuturor populațiilor care au folosit aramă (căldările, tăvile, cănile, ulcioarele, străchinile, crătițele, cazanele etc), piese specifice aromânilor (plosca, pahurul, zaharnița) sau piese specifice turco-tătarilor. Unele din aceste categorii sunt prețuite și utilizate și astăzi. Muzeul deține o colecție de covoare (155 de piese) de o valoare documentară și artistică deosebită. Realizate la războiul de țesut, din lână, covoarele au amplificat, prin utilizarea lor, frumusețea interiorului tradițional. Colecția cuprinde covoare de diferite dimensiuni, de la cele înguste și lungi plasate pe perete (paretar) sau acoperind una din piesele de mobilier tradițional (lăicer) până la cele mari, de formă dreptunghiulară și care acoperă, în genere, un perete (polog, scoarță, covor). Compozițiile decorative se remarcă printr-o evoluție de la simplu la complex, de la repetiția și alternanța unui număr de dungi la asocieri diverse ale motivelor geometrice, avimorfe și zoomorfe, florale sau antropomorfe. Denumirile motivelor sunt sugestive și reflectă legatura omului cu natura, preocupările lui cotidiene (aripile morii, unda apei, oul încondeiat, floarea pologului, viță de vie). Maniera de reprezentare a motivelor variază de la cea stilizată și geometrizată la cea liber desenată. Se disting în cadrul colecției, covoare cu compoziții complexe formate din buchete de flori, păsări, scene de viață urbană, interpretate naturalist și dispuse în medalioane. Cromatica variază între culorile discrete (tonuri de verde, ocru, bleumarin, albastru-închis) și cele tari (galben, portocaliu, roșu). Negrul (culoare de fond, în genere) și albul (folosit pentru evidențierea unor motive) echilibrează compozițiile cromatice. Aromânii constituie populația autohtonă romanizată din sudul Peninsulei Balcanice, dăinuind pâna astăzi în numeroase localități din Grecia, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia-Muntenegru. Între cele două războaie mondiale, ca urmare a înțelegerii intervenite între statul roman și celelalte state din sud-estul Europei, o parte din aromâni s-au strămutat în Dobrogea, la început în județele Durostor și Caliacra, care aparțin astăzi Bulgariei, de unde în 1940 s-au strămutat în județele Constanța și Tulcea. Prezența aromânilor în Dobrogea se relevă, din perspectiva conservării tradițiilor, prin patrimoniul pe care îl detine Muzeul de Etnografie și Arta Populară: 670 de piese (țesături de uz casnic și decorative, port popular). Țesăturile groase, policrome, de lana sau par de capra, detineau ponderea în casa aromâneasca traditionala. Ansamblul decorativ al țesăturilor (\"doaga anflucata’’, \"tenda’’, \"misale’’etc) se distinge prin alăturarea unor suprafețe de o mare sobrietate (grena, negru) cu pete de culoare ce imprima o anume luminozitate (roșu, galben, violet, verde). Portul tradițional al aromânilor face parte din marea și diversificata categorie a costumului balcanic. Costumul aromânesc, atat în varianta lui masculina cat și în cea feminina, se compune din piese numeroase și diverse (\" chiptare’’, \"fustane’’, \"canduse’’, \"poi’’, \"giumidane’’, \"sarica’’, \"cioariti’’, \"parpodzi’’ etc). Portul traditional aromânesc se evidentiază printr-un deosebit simț al valorilor plastice, de tip sculptural. Menționăm prezența în compoziția costumului aromânesc a podoabelor care imprima o anume strălucire și care sunt confecționate dintr-un aliaj de argint. Podoabele sunt folosite cu precădere în costumul femeiesc (\"tasul’’- un fel de disc prins pe caciula de postav; \"mardzeale’’- mărgele, cingătoare cu paftale - \"ploci’’, cercei - \"minghiusi’’). În portul barbatesc întîlnim o singura podoabă și anume lanțul de prins briceagul (\"chiusteca di custura’’). În execuția pieselor de podoabă (cca. 100 în colecția muzeului) se folosesc tehnici străvechi (filigranul, ciocănirea \"au repoussé’’, gravarea, intarsia).","summary":"The museum emerged in 2005 in a new location. It shelters ethnography and folk art collections from northern Dobrudja. The ethnography collection comprises a movable heritage presenting the practice of traditional trades and crafts, the lifestyle by the end of the 19th century and early 20th century up to 1950. It includes agricultural and animal breeding artefacts; artefacts for the practice of various trades and for daily life; icons. The folk art collection includes common and decorative fabrics representative for all the ethic groups; costumes and ornaments. The ethnographical collection includes about 1,600 artefacts representing the tools used at practising the traditional trades and crafts. In the field of the processing of animal and vegetable produce for nourishment, the collection presents tools, devices, instruments, weapons, artefacts for fishing, bee-keeping, tree growing, vinegrowing, seed processing, agriculture, flour-milling, animal breeding, and hunting. The ethnographic heritage comprises a remarkable metal vessel collection (267 pieces). The collection is diverse due to the metal used (copper, iron, silver, and lead) and owing to the manufacturing and decoration technique (cutting, boring, hammering, rolling, polishing, incision, filing, riveting, bending, and casting). The museum holds a carpet collection (155 pieces) of a special documentary and artistic value. The woollen carpets were manufactured at the weaving loom and they beautified the traditional interior. The collection comprises carpets of various sizes, from narrow ones to long ones set on the wall or covering one of the pieces of traditional furniture to large ones rectangular in shape usually covering a wall (rug or carpet). The collection includes remarkable carpets with complex compositions made up of bunches of flowers, birds, town life scenes, depicted in a naturalist manner and arranged as medallions. The colours ranged from discrete ones (green, ochre, and dark blue) to strong ones (yellow, orange and red). Black (a background colour) and white (used to emphasize motifs) balance the colour composition. The presence of the Aromanians in Dobrudja is revealed by their contribution to the preservation of the traditions reflected in the heritage owned by the museum: 670 pieces (household and decorative fabrics, costumes). The thick woollen or goat\u0027s-hair fabrics of various colours used to prevail in the Aroman traditional house. The traditional male and female Aromanian costumes are made up of numerous diverse pieces (peasant woollen skirts, shirts, long coats a.s.o.). The one hundred ornaments were executed by ancient techniques (filigree, \"au repoussé\" hammering, engraving, and intarsia)."},"location":{"zipCode":"820026","address":"Strada 9 Mai nr. 2","county":"Tulcea","locality":{"name":"Tulcea","code":"159623"},"geo":{"latitude":45.179523,"longitude":28.805883,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"County","profile":{"general":"Ethnography","main":"Ethnography"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_09.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_10.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_11.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_12.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_13.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_14.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_15.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_16.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_17.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_18.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_19.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_20.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"TL-II-m-B-05972"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Tulcea County Council","partOf":"Institute For Eco-Museum Researches \"Gavrilă Simion\""}},{"code":"6975501","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d620\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-TULCEA","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Paul Tocanie","position":"Șef Secție"},"phone":["",""],"web":["http://www.icemtl.ro/"],"director":"Sorin Ailincăi","fax":["0240.515.375"],"email":["arta@icemtl.ro","relatiipublice@icemtl.ro"],"timetable":["Tuesday - Sunday: 09:00 - 17:00 (summer), last admission 16:30","8:00 - 16:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"]},"founded":"1972","name":"Art Museum","description":{"details":"The Art Museum is hosted by a neoclassical building, raised between 1863 and 1865, as an administrative palace of Tulcea Sangeac, called at the time Pasha\u0027s Mansion, that underwent changes in time.

Muzeul tulcean a luat naștere în anul 1950, prin organizarea Muzeul de Științe ale Naturii. Din anul 1965 a început să funcționeze sub denumirea de Muzeul \"Delta Dunării\" cu 4 secții: istorie și arheologie, etnografie, știinte ale naturii, artă, fiind primul și singurul muzeu tematic din România acceptat la acea vreme, cu denumirea de Muzeul Deltei Dunării. În timp, muzeul s-a extins prin organizarea altor unități muzeale. Cea mai importantă realizare este organizarea în 1975 a Secției de istorie și arheologie din Parcul \"Monumentul Independenței\", în interiorul unui prim pavilion, ulterior extinsă prin construcția celui de-al doilea edificiu. Alte realizări importante se referă la organizarea Muzeului de Arta (1972) și a Muzeului de Etnografie și Artă Populară (1989). Implicarea instituției muzeale tulcene în diversificarea unor forme de valorificare a întregului patrimoniu cultural a dus, în cele din urmă, la modificarea structurii organizatorice a vechiului Muzeu al Deltei Dunarii și transformarea lui în Institut de Cercetări Eco-Muzeale. Legiferarea și reorganizarea muzeului tulcean s-au făcut prin deciziile nr. 118, 119/19 martie 1993, Institutul urmând să-și desfășoare activitatea în domeniile: ecologie, etnologie, istoria artelor, istorie și arheologie. În prezent, fiecare obiectiv muzeal al Institutului desfășoară activitatea sa proprie prin care încearcă să îmbine riguros activitatea știintifică de cercetare, conservare, restaurare, valorificare și îmbogățire a patrimoniului cultural, cu acțiuni care să evidențieze activități sinergetice cu alte domenii. Noua strategie a instituției are în vedere faptul că produsul său cultural trebuie dezvoltat într-un context de integrare care să implice educația, turismul, dezvoltarea regională, cooperarea transfrontalieră și transnațională, urmărind crearea unor efecte multiplicatoare prin acțiuni pluridisciplinare. Istorie și arheologie (pre și protoistorie, greco-elenistică, daco-romană, medievală), tezaure monetare cu piese romane, genoveze, tătărești; științele naturii; artă plastică și decorativă; etnografie; bibliofilie, carte veche, bibliotecă (peste 87.000 volume).","summary":"Tulcea Museum was established in the year 1950 by the foundation of the Natural Sciences Museum. Since 1965 it has been the \"Danube Delta\" Museum with four departments: history and archaeology, ethnography, natural sciences and art. It is the first and only theme museum in Romania accepted at that time, under the name of Danube Delta Museum. In time the museum has grown due to the emergence of other museum units. The most significant achievement is the 1975 emergence of the History and Archaeology Department in the \"Independence Monument\" Park, inside an initial pavilion, later extended due to the construction of the second edifice. Other important achievements involve the emergence of the Art Museum (1972) and the Ethnography and Folk Art Museum (1989). The endeavours of the Tulcea Museum institution towards diversifying the forms of valorisation of the entire cultural heritage in the end led to a changed organizational structure of the Old Danube Delta Museum and its turning into an Institute for Eco-Museum Researches. Tulcea Museum was reorganized by the decisions nos. 118, 119/the 19th of March 1993, as the Institute would conduct its activity in the fields: ecology, ethnography, art history, history and archaeology. Currently, each museum of the Institute conducts its own activity trying to rigorously mingle the scientific activity of cultural heritage research, conservation, restoration, valorisation and enriching with actions pointing to synergic domains. The new strategy of the institution considers that its cultural product has to develop in an integration context involving education, tourism, regional development, international cooperation, aiming at creating diverse effects by multidisciplinary actions. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure."},"location":{"zipCode":"820009","access":"DN 22, E 27; Railways: Bucharest-Tulcea, Constanța-Tulcea","address":"Strada Progresului nr. 32 (sediu administrativ)","county":"Tulcea","locality":{"name":"Tulcea","code":"159623"},"geo":{"latitude":45.180327,"longitude":28.805502,"target":"Muzeu"}},"accreditation":["O.M.C.I.N.","nr.","2102/02.03.2017","Acreditare"],"collection":{"importance":"Regional","profile":{"general":"Archaeology","main":"Archaeology"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975500_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975500_02.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"TL-II-m-B-05994"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Tulcea County Council","supervisorFor":[{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d619\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-Panait-Cerna-CERNA-Tulcea","code":"6975505","name":"\"Panait Cerna\" Memorial House"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d628\u0026-Gospodaria-Taraneasca-de-la-Enisala-ENISALA-Tulcea","code":"6975506","name":"Enisala Homestead Museum"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d697\u0026-Monumentul-paleocrestin-NICULITEL-Tulcea","code":"6975508","name":"Palaeo-Christian Monument"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1536\u0026-Muzeul-Farul-Sulinei-SULINA-Tulcea","code":"51620000153","name":"\"Old Lighthouse Of Sulina\" Museum"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1827\u0026-Casa-Avramide-TULCEA","code":"6975509","name":"\"Avramide\" House - Collections House"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d624\u0026-Centrul-Ecoturistic-Delta-Dunarii-TULCEA","code":"6975503","name":"Danube Delta Eco-Touristic Centre"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d620\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-TULCEA","code":"6975501","name":"Art Museum"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d625\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-TULCEA","code":"6975502","name":"Museum Of Ethnography And Folk Art"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d626\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-si-Arheologie-TULCEA","code":"6975507","name":"History And Archaeology Museum"}]}},{"code":"6975400","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1752\u0026-Casa-Taraneasca-Iacob-Macut-CALINESTI-OAS-Satu-Mare","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Maria Mihăilă"},"web":["http://www.muzeusm.ro/expozitii/retea-muzeala/casa-taraneasca-calinesti-oas/"],"director":"Liviu Marta","timetable":["Tuesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 18:00, Saturday: 10:00 - 14:00 (summer)","Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00, Saturday: 10:00 - 14:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"]},"founded":"1991","name":"\"Jacob Măcuț\" Homestead","description":{"details":"The house was built in 1727, respecting the traditional architectural characteristics.

Ethnographic Department At Princely Inn","description":{"details":"Secția etnografie cuprinde: Hanul Domnesc (pavilionar) și Muzeul Satului Bucovinean (în aer liber). Hanul Domnesc: clădire cu două niveluri, construită la sfârșitul secolului al XVI-lea și începutul celui următor, a fost destinată găzduirii unor dregători străini, oaspeți de seamă și mari negustori. Odată cu ocuparea nordului Moldovei de către imperiul Habsburgic în 1775, Hanul Domnesc își schimbă destinația, devenind casă de vânătoare pentru membri familiei imperiale. În 1962 a fost restaurat de la nivelul pivniței până la acoperiș, urmărindu-se reconstituirea elementelor de arhitectură interioară de la parter, în fosta bucătărie a hanului, pe locul cuptorului s-a ridicat un altul inspirat din cuptoarele moldovenești, la etaj s-au păstrat grinzile de stejar ale plafoanelor celor două coridoare. Ca elemente arhitecturale de epocă recâștigate odată cu refacerea zidurilor, construcția Hanului Domnesc ca monument de arhitectură a intrat în tradiția culturală a Sucevei ca vechi han medieval. Expoziția permanentă de la parterul clădirii reconstituie atmosfera de epocă a unui han care găzduiește oaspeții de seamă, dregători, negustori. Colecții: port popular, podoabe, țesături de interior, ceramică, unelte, ustensile, instalații, meșteșuguri, obiecte de uz gospodăresc, obiecte de iluminat, transport, elemente de arhitectură, mobilier țărănesc, obiecte de cult, recuzită obiceiuri populare, instrumente muzicale, obiective de arhitectură populară, case grajduri, biserica crâșmă, anexe gospodărești, diverse. În salonul privat este reconstituită o sobă de influență austriacă cu plăci de ceramică de tip Kuty, mobilat cu piese sculptate ornamentate cu motive populare tradiționale: masă cu scaune cu spătare înalte sculptate, dulap cu vitrină pentru veselă și piese de porțelan, sticlă și metal (farfurii, căni, suporturi pentru pahare, tăvi, tabacheră, lulea, etc.). Hanul Domnesc a fost într-o perioadă (sfârșitul secolului al XVIII-lea) casă de vânătoare, atmosfera acestei perioade fiind ilustrată cu obiecte specifice acestei ocupații - pe un rastel sunt expuse puști de vânătoare panoplie cu pistoale și pumnale. Ambianța salonului este completată cu blănuri de mistreț. Urmează cămara în care sunt obiecte de uz casnic necesare preparării hranei. Aici sunt râșnița de mână, teascul pentru ulei, cumpăna, cofa pentru apă, butoaie, butoiașe, balerci, saci pentru făină, tăvi de cpot, piuă. În bucătărie, elementul principal este cuptorul cu plită, rolă și cuptor de pâine. Vasele necesare sunt așezate pe un grilaj din jurul hornului (linguroaie, tăvi, tigăi, oale, căni); pe plită și pe vatră: oală pentru sarmale, chiup pentru borș, lopată, clește, cociorvă, piuă pentru sare. Mobilierul din bucătărie este cel specific: masă, blidare, laiță, lingurare. Circuitul de vizitare trece apoi în sala de han. Aici sunt mese cu laițe și scaune, poliță cu vase din ceramică, blidare , butoiașe, balerci, colțare. Pe masă sunt sfeșnice, strachini, linguri, fund de mămăligă. Această cameră este destinată servirii mesei. Inventarul mesei este completat cu textile de interior, ștergare de mână, țesături de cânepă. Urmează camera de odihnă cu mobilier specific: pat cu tăblii, banchetă, jilț, scrin , lavoar cu oglindă cu cană și lighean de porțelan. Interiorul acestei camere este completat cu țesături de factură populară: ștergare, așternut de pat, scoarță pentru perete și blană de urs pe perete și de mistreț pe jos. O sobă de încălzit și un cufăr pentru haine întregesc inventarul acestei încăperi care-și așteaptă oaspeții. Holul de intrare face legătura dintre celelalte spații. Acici sunt expuse piese de harnașament (șei, tarnițe, curele, hamuri) și obiecte legate de transport și vânătoare. Este expusă o căruță, un mic atelier de fierărie cu nicovală, ciocane, clești. Pivnița cu cele două camere legate printr-un culoar boltit constituie un punct de atracție prin arhitectura lor și prin reconstitiurea funcționalității lor. În spațiul de la intrare sunt expuse butoaie pentru băuturi și pentru alimente, iar în a doua încăpere este amenajată o cramă cu mese și laițe cu obiecte din lemn și ceramică. Interacțiunea dintre reconstituirea interioarelor specifice hanului și prezența obiectelor de factură populară fac trecerea spre etsjul clădirii unde sunt expuse toate genurile de artă populară din principalele zone etnografice ale județului. Zona etnografică Humor se remarcă prin meșteșugul prelucrării artistice a lemnului care s-a materializat în obiecte de mare frumusețe ca formă și ornamentație, meșteșug practicat și astăzi cu aceeași măiestrie. Dintre țesături se remarcă ștergarele de perete și țesăturile de traistă în carouri. Costumele tradiționale purtate în toate anotimpurile oferă diferite variante artistice locale. Compuse din ștergar de cap cu vârste colorate, cămașă femeiască bogat ornamentată cu fir, paiete și mărgele, catrință sobră cu dungi înguste de culoare galben auriu și bondiță ornamentată cu șnur negru. Zona Dornelor se distinge prin velnițile de pat cu decor liniar, în culoarea naturală a lânii; ștergarele de perete cu motive geometrice realizate în tehnica alesăturii cu acul. O piesă de port deosebită este cămașa cu platcă cu motive vegetale aplicate cu mărgele. Cele patru ansambluri de port tradițional încadrează mai bine de un secol de conciliere a influențelor vechilor tradiții de natură geometrică specifică nordului Moldovei cu stilizări vegetale de influență năsăudeană. Salbele de dotă realizate cu ajutorul unei zgarde cu ornamente de mărgele, de care se prind monedele reprezintă o particuleritate zonală ce completează costumul femeiesc. Zona etnografică Rădăuți se caracterizează printr-o realiazre artistică superioară în toate domeniile creației populare. Se remarcă scoarțele, lăicerele și grindărașele cu motive geometrice și colorit de natură vegetală în general. Costumele populare ilustrează toate tipurile de haine tradiționale purtate de locuitorii acestor așezări. Zona Rădăuți se impune, de asemenea, prin meșteșugul cojocăritului reprezentat prin cele câteva tipuri de haine de blană (cojocel, pieptar, pieptar cu poale) cu o ornamentație bogată ce le subliniază croiala, într-un colorit viu cu motive vegetale. Meșteșugul olăritului este reprezentat prin ceramica neagră de Marginea și cea smălțuită de Rădăuți. Zona etnografică Câmpulung continuă străvechea tradiție a prelucrării lemnului prin realizarea diferitelor obiecte, de la furca de tors la cofița pentru aghiasmă și tiparul de prescure. Portul tradițional al zonei se remarcă prin cămașa femeiască cu motive geometrice și rafinament coloristic și cu bondițele cu prim de jder sau de dihor și cu decor geometric cu mătase și mărgele. Sărbătorile de iarnă aduc în scenă cerbul care este ornamentat cu materiale strălucitoare cu mulți canafi colorați, personaj marcant în alaiurile din zonă. În spațiul de trecere sunt expuse piese de artă populară actuală din toate genurile de creație: țesături, ceramică, obiecte de lemn, coarne pentru praf de pușcă.","summary":"The ethnography department includes: the Princely Inn (pavilion) and the Bukovina Village Museum (open air). The Princely Inn, a historic monument and the oldest mediaeval preserved in the city of Suceava, built by early 17th century, used to host foreign high officials, personalities and great merchants. After northern Moldavia was occupied by the Austrian Empire in 1775, the Princely Inn changed its function into hunting house for the members of the imperial family. In 1962 it was restored from the level of the cellar to the roof; in the former kitchen of the inn, on the place of the kiln, another one was raised, inspired by Moldavian kilns. On the upper floor the oak-tree beams of the ceilings of the two corridors have been preserved. Due to the period architectural elements that emerged when the walls were rebuilt, the construction of the Princely Inn was included in the cultural tradition of Suceava as an old mediaeval inn.  The permanent exhibition on the ground floor of the building reconstructs the period atmosphere of the inn and comprises the private hall, the kitchen, the pantry of the inn, the room of the public house, the living room and the cellar. The interaction between the reconstruction of the interiors specific of the inn and the presence of the folk artefacts lead to the upper floor of the building, where the exhibits include folk art items of all kinds from the main ethnographic areas of the county of Humor, Dorna, Câmpulung Moldovenesc and Rădăuți. The museum includes in its heritage folk art items (13,000 artefacts) gathered in costume collections, pottery, fabrics, ornaments, wooden, bone, metal artefacts, musical instruments, wedding and New Year customs paraphernalia, traditional furniture, brandings."},"location":{"zipCode":"720066","access":"DE 85; DN 17 roads","address":"Strada Ciprian Porumbescu nr. 5","county":"Suceava","locality":{"name":"Suceava","code":"146272"},"geo":{"latitude":47.644572,"longitude":26.257622,"target":"Muzeu"}},"accreditation":["O.M.C.I.N.","nr.","2794/14.11.2017","Reacreditare"],"collection":{"importance":"National","profile":{"general":"Ethnography","main":"Ethnography"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968600_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968600_02.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"SV-II-m-B-05476"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Suceava County Council","partOf":"Bukovina National Museum","supervisorFor":[{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d586\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-Bucovina.-Muzeul-Satului-Bucovinean-SUCEAVA","code":"6968505","name":"Museum Of Bukovina.

Built at the beginning of the 20th century, the building-historical monument keeps its facade almost unchanged, instead the interior has undergone numerous transformations over time, especially since it became the headquarters of the History Museum. The building that housed the former Prefecture from the Austrian period was transformed to be used as a museum, the last changes being made between 2014 and 2016, within the European project A heritage building-museum for the third millennium. The new permanent exhibition of the History Museum was inaugurated on July 31, 2016, in the same location on the first floor, as the previous exhibition. The new presentation is based on local history, reflected in the many archaeological discoveries made over time, but also in the many events that had as their central place the current territory of Suceava County. The numerous heritage objects on display are explained in their historical context with the help of touchscreens existing throughout the exhibition, complementing the knowledge of visitors eager to learn new information."},"location":{"zipCode":"720003","address":"Strada Ștefan cel Mare nr. 33","county":"Suceava","locality":{"name":"Suceava"}},"collection":{"importance":"National","profile":{"general":"History","main":"History"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968508_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968508_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968508_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968508_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968508_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968508_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6968508_07.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Suceava County Council","partOf":"Bukovina National Museum"}},{"code":"6968507","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d713\u0026-Cetatea-de-Scaun-a-Sucevei-SUCEAVA","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Dan Petrovici"},"phone":["0230.216.439","0743.950.415","(muz.eog.raf",""],"web":["https://muzeulbucovinei.ro/cetatea-de-scaun-a-sucevei/"],"director":"Constantin Emil Ursu","fax":["0230.522.979"],"email":["contact@muzeulbucovinei.ro"],"timetable":["9.00 - 18.00 (21.00 May - August)"]},"name":"Princely Court Of Suceava","description":{"details":"The ruins of the Princely Residence of Suceava, seat of the princes of Moldavia during the Mediaeval Period (starting with the 14th century until late 17th century), was first mentioned in a document in 10/11 of February 1388.

The most recent open air museum of Romania emerged during the eighth decade of the last century, when the Bukovina village had numerous monuments of folk architecture, but unfortunately, the activity - consisting in transferring several monuments and reconstructing three of them - was interrupted. After 1990, new homesteads and technical installations were moved on the plateau of the city, as 30 monuments folk architecture were reconstructed and put on display. Designed as a traditional Bukovina village, the open air exhibition will comprise 80 monuments of folk architecture: a church, a school, homesteads, workshops, technical installations, a public house. Monuments of folk architecture from the whole Bukovina are reconstructed on six hectares. Vama Church, monument of architecture, dates from 1783. The building is richly adorned with zoomorphic motifs (horse head) and geometric ones (rosette). The church is a classical triconch plan, and the original painting is extant only in the area of the altar. The bell tower was reconstructed next to the church.

Din chiar momentul inaugurării, muzeul și-a definit funcțiile sale moderne: conservativ-patrimonială și instructiv-educațională. Apoi, muzeul s-a dezvoltat sub semnul vremurilor și împrejurărilor pe care acestea le-au impus, înregistrând o continuitate firească, manifestată în preocuparea pentru creșterea patrimoniului, pentru îmbunătățirea mijloacelor de expunere și evidență, pentru cunoașterea fenomenelor pe care el le ilustra. După 1990, Corneliu Bucur, cu un colectiv restrâns de specialiști, a reușit să întrerupă îndelungatul exil al patrimoniului etnografic românesc, organizând Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" ca un important segment al memoriei și biografiei naționale. O condiție indispensabilă pentru înțelegerea oportunității conceperii proiectului tematic al Muzeului Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" ca muzeu interdisciplinar și plurietnic și înțelegerea mecanismelor producerii interferențelor culturale, în condițiile conviețuirii lor multiseculare, a constat din schimbarea paradigmei muzeale. Dintr-un muzeu etnografic clasic, cu expuneri de serii de obiecte, muzeul modern trebuie conceput ca un muzeu de istorie a civilizației, accentul trecând dinspre factologic spre fenomenologic, spre relaționarea și conexiunea proceselor etnoculturale. Vizitatorul este invitat să caute și să descopere chipul unui țăran complet, ce știe \"mersul stelelor\" dar și \"mersul lumii\". Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" este, în primul rând, trezorierul valorilor patrimoniale moștenite de la Muzeul \"Asociațiunii\" și recuperate după 1950. În registrele inventar există 9 002 obiecte înregistrate sub sigla \"A\", împărțite pe șase colecții: 6 523 broderii, 1 025 port-textile, 567 obiecte de cult, 539 lemn, os, fier, 330 ceramică și 18 păpuși. Colecțiile s-au îmbogățit, în ultima jumătate de secol, ajungând astăzi la 46 314 obiecte din care: 21 638 port-textile, 9 868 broderii, 7 137 ceramică, 3 938 obiecte de cult, 3 733 lemn, os, fier. Colecția de port are o însemnătate deosebită în structura organizatorică a patrimoniului, nu numai numeric, ci mai ales prin faptul că sunt reflectate, destul de echilibrat, toate zonele etnografice ale țării, oferindu-ne posibilitatea de a obține o imagine clară a costumului românesc tradițional. Din punct de vedere tipologic colecția cuprinde cămăși femeiești și bărbătești, poale, cătrințe, fote, vâlnice, pantaloni, acoperăminte de cap, haine de blană și dimie dar și încălțăminte. Nu lipsesc nici accesoriile vestimentare, impresionante podoabe realizate cu mărgele sau turnate în metal. Mai mult de 870 de piese sunt cămăși femeiești reprezentative pentru întregul teritoriu al României. Aproximativ 642 dintre acestea provin din spațiul transilvan, iar 469 aparțin, din punct de vedere etnografic, Zonei Sibiului și sudului Transilvaniei. 102 ii (dintre care: 2 ii de fetiță, 3 ii de mireasă, 6 ii cu poale) sunt reprezentative pentru localitățile care întregesc subzona etnografică Mărginimea Sibiului. Păpușile erau, la începutul secolului trecut, o modalitate specifică pentru etalarea costumelor populare, \"exponatul rege\" al majorității expozițiilor etnografice. Asociate temelor legate de port dar și de industrie de casă - păpușile au beneficiat de o mare popularitate, dezvoltându-se o adevărată tehnică de confecționarea a păpușilor - suporturi în expoziție. Textilele de interior reprezintă toate zonele etnografice ale țării. Numărul mare al acestora se explică și prin frecvența lor în gospodăria tradițională, fie cu funcție utilitară, fie cu funcție decorativă. Colecția de obiecte de artă religioasă țărănească cuprinde icoane pictate pe lemn și sticlă, cruci, pristolnice, xilogravuri, odoare bisericești. Icoanele aflate în colecția muzeului, pictate pe suport de lemn sau de sticlă, respectă temele iconografice bizantine, deși, uneori, maniera de interpretare este creativă. Principalele centre de iconari reprezentate în colecțiile muzeului sunt cele de la Nicula și Gherla - Cluj, Laz și Lancrăm - Alba, Șcheii Brașovului și Făgăraș - Brașov, Mărginimea Sibiului și Sibiu. În colecția muzeului se află icoane realizate atât de Savu Moga din Arpaș cât și de Matei Purcăriu Țâmforea din Cârțișoara. Colecția de lemn, mobilier și feronerie este și ea reprezentativă pentru întregul spațiu românesc. Nu lipsesc lăzile de zestre decorate prin incizie, crestare sau pictare. Blidarele, dulapurile pentru vase sau alimente (podișoare și armăroaie) reprezintă o grupă de mobilier cu utilitate înrudită și cu o mare varietate a formelor și ornamentelor. Nu lipsesc mesele de la cele rotunde sau dreptunghiulare, cu patru sau trei picioare, joase, până la impresionantele mese cu sertare pictate din Mărginimea Sibiului, după modelul săsesc. Colecția cuprinde și unelte destinate diferitelor ocupații tradiționale - pluguri de lemn, juguri, părți din mijloace de transport, tiocuri pentru gresia de ascuțit coasa, șei, harnașamente. Un segment de patrimoniu, deosebit de important, este alcătuit de obiectele de ceramică. Colecția s-a îmbogățit treptat ajungând astăzi să cuprindă piese reprezentative pentru multe dintre centrele de olari dispărute de pe harta etnografică a țării. Piesele existente în colecție au fost realizate în tehnici diferite: modelare cu mâna, modelare cu roata, modelare prin presare în tipare. Regăsim în colecție ceramică \"cu brâie\" din Biniș, Baia Mare, Oboga sau Curtea de Argeș; vase pictate înainte de ardere din Bihor și Banat; ceramică pictată cu cornul și pensula la Vlădești, Horezu, Leheceni, Târgu Lăpuș, Vama, Valea Izei, dar și ceramică imprimată cu \"rotița\" din Marginea, ceramică \"cu sigilii\" din Oboga și Româna, vase lustruite cu piatra din Marginea, Poiana Deleni și Săcel, ceramică angobată din Vlădești. Alături de acestea se află și inventarul atelierului de olar - roata pentru modelat, troaca, mezdreaua, cuțitoaia, cornul, gaița, râșnița etc. Patrimoniul muzeului cuprinde și importante piese ce alcătuiesc recuzita obiceiurilor din ciclul vieții sau a celor de peste an. Cea mai numeroasă categorie de obiecte o reprezintă ouăle încondeiate, ce vin să depună mărturie despre un meșteșug practicat cândva în toată țara. Aceste \"mici capodopere\" vorbesc despre măiestria și credința celor ce le-au creat. Cele mai interesante exemplare provin din nordul Moldovei și din zona Vrancei. În Colecția \"ASTRA\" întâlnim și ouăle încondeiate de Bran sau cele din zona Olteniei, deosebit de fastuoase prin simplitatea și noblețea armoniilor de roșu, galben, negru și alb. În paralel cu efortul expozițional, Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" a inițiat și aplicat, în baza teoriilor moderne, de reprezentare integrală a culturii populare tradiționale, în expresiile sale materiale și spirituale, conceptul modern de \"museum vivum\", prin dezvoltarea unui adevărat sistem național de cercetare, valorificare, consolidare, catalizare și transmitere, a manifestărilor circumscrise patrimoniului cultural intangibil. Întreg acest program a fost realizat în deplin consens cu Recomandările UNESCO din anii 1989 și 1999 privind încurajarea și stimularea prezervării active a valorilor culturii naționale, reprezentând tradițiile popoarelor lumii, începând cu meșteșugurile artistice tradiționale, adoptând sintagma UNESCO - \"Tezaure umane vii\". rezintă două expoziții permanente: Muzeul etnografic în aer liber și Monumente de arhitectură și tehnică populară. Muzeul etnografic în aer liber a debutat în 1963 ca un muzeu al \"tehnicii populare\". Împărțit în patru sectoare tematice expoziționale abordează întregul sistem ocupațional tradițional. A cumulat cea mai complexă colecție de monumente de arhitectură și tehnică populară din România și o vastă arhivă documentar-științifică și tehnică despre universul creației tehnice țărănești. Un sistem instrumental manual, de o varietate tipologică impresionantă, demonstrînd o continuitate de viață și de creația materială în această parte a Europei acoperă practic cvasitotalitatea ocupațiilor tradiționale. Categoria \"monumentelor de tehnică populară\" excelează prin marea varietate tematică aparținând \"instalațiilor de industrie populară\", având în finalul expoziției patru mari complexe de industrii țărănești (provenite din Oltenia, Muntenia și Transilvania), dar și printr-o cvasicompletitudine tipologică greu de regăsit într-un muzeu din afara României. Colecția mulinologică este un caz cu totul unic, cele 33 mori de cereale prezentând toate tipurile energetice de mori cunoscute în spațiul Euro-Asiei, ce demonstrează între altele caracterul agrarian al civilizației tradiționale a poporului român. Monumentele de arhitectură populară prezintă o diversitate a tipurilor regionale. Arta populară este prezentă, atât în decorarea interioarelor locuințelor, cât și în atelierele meșteșugărești, fie că e vorba de piese textile sau ceramice, din lemn sau din metal, din chihlimbar sau din sticlă, mobilier funcțional sau recuzită religioasă. Din 1990 s-a adăugat sectorul destinat monumentelor de utilitate publică. Patrimoniul muzeal cuprinde 143 monumente, conținând 346 construcții și peste 20.000 obiecte de inventar funcțional, fiind cel mai mare și mai bogat muzeu din România. Acest muzeu este în primul rând trezorierul valorilor patrimoniale moștenite de la Muzeul \"Asociațiunii\" (înființat în anul 1905 și desființat, prin dictat comunist, în 1950).

Infrastructura ultramodernă de relaționare interactivă cu publicul prin două sisteme info-terminale cu monitoare senzitive (două mici enciclopedii care acoperă tematic domeniile patrimoniului tehnic, civilizației populare românești și a celei transilvane, prin excelență multietnice și multiculturale, alături de prezentarea programelor culturale specifice și a diverselor forme de asociere în sensul conservării și transmiterii între generații a tradițiilor culturale ale meșteșugurilor și artei populare - cum este de pildă Academia Artelor Tradiționale din România ), un sistem mobil fără fir de ghidare electronică în limba română și alte 3 limbi de circulație internațională, pentru Muzeul în Aer Liber din Dumbrava Sibiului, activ din acest an, precum și puternica prezență pe Internet prin site-ul Internet al Complexului Muzeal Național \"ASTRA\" (www.muzeulastra.ro), site-ul dedicat Centenarului Muzeului \"ASTRA\", sărbătorit în anul 2005 (www.centenar.muzeulastra.ro), site-ul Muzeului de Etnografie Universală \"Franz Binder\" (www.franzbinder.sibiu.ro) și revista virtuală cu apariție lunară a complexului, adresată în special tineretului și vârstelor școlare - Muzeul ASTRA Jurnal (www.jurnal.muzeulastra.ro) alături de site-ul Fundației Muzeului \"ASTRA\", site-ul Studioului de film \"ASTRA\", precum și câteva pagini web dedicate diverselor programe culturale în derulare, conferă Complexului Național Muzeal \"ASTRA\" o alură dinamică. Muzeul Civilizației Populare Tradiționale \"Astra\", cu sediul în Calea Rășinarilor, organizat actualmente pe o suprafață de 100 ha, a fost inaugurat în 1967 și a funcționat sub titulatura de Muzeul Tehnicii Populare până în 1990, când succesiv prin re-orientarea către linia muzeului european modern, a devenit Muzeul Civilizației Populare din România, iar din 1992, Muzeul Civilizației Populare Tradiționale \"ASTRA\", iar din anul 2001, unitate muzeală de bază a C.N.M \"ASTRA\" . M.C.P.T \"ASTRA\" deține în patrimoniu 197 monumente de arhitectură populară și peste 22.000 de piese etnografice în inventarul patrimoniului mobil. Muzeul de Etnogfrafie Universală \"Franz Binder\", inaugurat în 1993, în sediul din Piața Mică, nr.11, primul muzeu din România de acest fel, dedicat studiului și valorificării în context european a unui prețios patrimoniu de etnografie non-europeană (3500 de piese etnografice provenind din Africa, Australia, Asia, America de Nord, Centrală și de Sud) cu o tematică diversă acoperită de cele două sectoare expoziționale (expoziția de bază: Din cultura și arta popoarelor lumii și sectorul expozițiilor temporare: Din creația artizanală a popoarelor lumii). Muzeul are în colecțiile sale piese antice egiptene de excepție, piese de tezaur aparținând culturilor indigene central africane, piese de artă populară și artizanat provenind din toate colțurile lumii, de un real rafinament artistic și de o mare diversitate tipologică. Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" este depozitarul moștenirii culturale a Muzeului \"ASOCIAȚIUNII\", înființat în anul 1905 și cunoscut sub cognomenul de Muzeul \"ASTRA\", a cunoscut un parcurs istoric oarecum advers, fiind desființat în 1950 și patrimoniul mutat în depozitele Muzeului Brukenthal. După 1990, patrimoniul etnografic al secției de artă populară este transferat la Muzeul Civilizației Populare și este conceput noul proiect de Muzeu al Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\", prin care tematic sunt însușite preocupările pentru studiul și promovarea artei populare autentice românești și a celorlalte componente etnice aparținând multiculturalității specifice spațiului transilvănean și coordonează un complex program de asistență, protecție și promovare a ceea ce prin Programul \"Tezaure umane vii\" este definit conform unor tratate internaționale la care România este cosemnatar, patrimoniul imaterial. MCT \"ASTRA\" are în organizare sau co-organizare târgurile și alte manifestări specifice de peste an, dintre care cea mai importantă este \"Festivalul Național al Tradițiilor Populare\" . Actualmente colecțiile Muzeului Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" numără 36.629 piese etnografice. Muzeul De Etnografie și Artă Populară Săsească \"Emil Sigerus\", cu sediul în Piața Huet, nr.12, deține în patrimoniul său mai bine de 7000 de piese etnografice săsesți și ungurești, una din colecțiile cele mai valoroase fiind cea de cahle (plăci ceramice pentru sobe), valorificată în expoziția de bază \"Cahle transilvănene (sec. XV - XIX)\" . Existența acestui muzeu asigură cunoașterea și înțelegerea rolului ocupat de sașii transilvăneni în cultura românească și universală, în special în acest spațiu de confluentă a mai multor culturi, cum este Transilvania în general și Sibiul în special centru cultural săsesc, aflat chiar în inima uneia dintre cele trei zone de colonizare săsească). Muzeul \"Emil Sigerus\" a dezvoltat începând din 1997 un program complex de salvare, conservare și valorificare a patrimoniului mobil și imobil al culturii și civilizației tradiționale a sașilor transilvăneni. Manifestări culturale de anvergură națională și internațională sunt numeroase, se desfășoară anual în sezonul estival - turistic, în muzeul în aer liber din Dumbrava Sibiului. Târgul creatorilor populari din România este o manifestare cultural-națională (reunește anual, în luna august, de Sf. Maria cei mai valoroși creatori ai centrelor de veche tradiție meșteșugărească, reprezentând toate genurile artei populare: țesut, brodat, olărit, prelucrarea lemnului, osului, metalelor, confecționarea instrumentelor populare, muzicale, a măștilor, pictura pe lemn și sticlă, încondeierea ouălor). Olimpiada națională a copiilor \"meștesuguri artistice tradiționale\" este etapă națională în cadrul unui program de recuperare și revitalizare de către tineri, în contextul vieții contemporane, a creațiilor populare tradiționale, pentru dezvoltarea talentului acestora în sensul producerii unor valori autentice de artă populară tradițională,care are loc anual. La această olimpiadă participă copii cu vârsta cuprinsă între 6 și 18 ani,selecționați la fazele județene. Olimpiada este organizată împreună cu Ministerul Educației, Cercetării și Tineretului. Festivalul național al tradițiilor populare, organizat după modelul \"Smithsonian Folklife Festival\" Washington D.C., la care România a participat în vara anului 1999, reunește cei mai valoroși și reputați creatori de artă populară din toate domeniile culturii și civilizației populare. Aceștia provin din medii sociale și etnice diferite, din diverse regiuni și zone etnografice ale țării, selecția lor fiind făcută de specialiști în domeniu. La fiecare ediție a festivalului participă reprezentanții câte unui judet din Transilvania, Muntenia, Moldova si din Republica Moldova. Este conceput ca o manifestare spectaculară și interactivă, de prezentare scenică sau lucrativă, de dialog direct între meșteșugari și publicul vizitator. Cei aproximativ 350 de participanți asigură acoperirea celor 7 secțiuni tematice din programul festivalului: arte religioase (tradiții cultice legate de practicile religioase), literatura populară (basme, eresuri, poezie și teatru popular), arte muzicale (interpreți vocali și instrumentali), arte coregrafice (dans popular), arte plastice tradiționale (meșteșuguri artistice), arte mecanice (creație tehnică tradițională), arta culinară (meniuri după rețete tradiționale) pregătite și servite participanților și turiștilor.","historic":"ASTRA Museum was founded in 1905 by the Transylvanian Association for the Literature and Culture of the Romanian People.

In 1990 the Folk Art and Folk Technology Museum departments emerged into an independent museum unit: “ASTRA” Traditional Folk Civilization Museum stretching over a surface of 96 ha and having two permanent exhibitions: the open air ethnographic museum and the modern wooden sculpture Exhibition. “Franz Binder” World Ethnographic Museum was inaugurated in 1993 and is the first unique museum of extra-European ethnography in Romania. “Cornel Irimie” Memorial Room has preserved memories relating to Cornel Irimie’s outstanding personality, who – from 1953 to his death – organized and led the ethnography and folk art department, and later became manager of the museum. “Emil Sigerus” Museum of Saxon Ethnography and Folk Art, since it was established in 1997, has assumed a complex programme for rescuing, conserving and valorizing the movable and immovable heritage of the traditional culture and civilization of the Transylvanian Saxons. The Museum of Gypsy Culture and Civilization aims at rescuing and conserving the cultural property of the cultural heritage of the Gypsy community (it is the only museum of this kind in Romania)."},"location":{"zipCode":"550182","access":"Tram , bus nos 1; Trolley bus 1, 4 (Dumbrava Sibiului)","address":"Piața Mică nr. 11 - 12","county":"Sibiu","locality":{"name":"Sibiu","code":"143469"},"geo":{"latitude":45.797619,"longitude":24.150977,"target":"Muzeu"}},"accreditation":["O.M.C.I.N.","nr.","2557/13.07.2018","Acreditare"],"collection":{"importance":"National","profile":{"general":"Ethnography","main":"Ethnography"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_06.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"SB-II-m-B-12114"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Sibiu County Council","supervisorFor":[{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1661\u0026-Centrul-Cultural-Memorial-Dr.-Gheorghe-Telea-Bologa-NOUL-ROMAN-Sibiu","code":"6906505","name":"\"Dr. Gheorghe Telea-Bologa\" Memorial Cultural Centre"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d549\u0026-Muzeul-Civilizatiei-Populare-Traditionale-ASTRA-SIBIU","code":"69665022","name":"\"Astra\" Museum Of Traditional Folk Civilisation"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d715\u0026-Muzeul-Civilizatiei-Transilvane-ASTRA-SIBIU","code":"6966510","name":"\"Astra\" Museum Of Transylvanian Civilisation"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d714\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-Saseasca-Emil-Sigerus-SIBIU","code":"6966509","name":"\"Emil Sigerus\" Museum Of Saxon Ethnography And Folk Art"},{"cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d531\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-Universala-Franz-Binder-SIBIU","code":"69665021","name":"\"Franz Binder\" World Ethnography Museum"}]}},{"code":"6966501","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d538\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-SIBIU","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Cornel Lungu","position":"Director"},"phone":["0269.218.143"],"web":["http://www.brukenthalmuseum.ro/"],"director":"Sabin Adrian Luca","fax":["0269.211.545"],"timetable":["Wednesday - Sunday: 10:00-18:00","Monday, Tuesday: close"]},"founded":"1959","name":"History Museum","description":{"details":"Clădirile care compun ansamblul Muzeului de Istorie reprezintă unul dintre cele mai impresionante monumente de arhitectură civilă gotică, cu elemente de Renaștere. Având inițial destinația de locuință, casa Altemberger-Pempflinger (sub forma unui turn-locuință), a fost cumpărată de Primăria orașului în anul 1549. De atunci aici va funcționa Primăria orașului, până în 1923, și Arhiva orașului și a comunității săsești din Transilvania până în 1948. Lucrările de restaurare ale monumentului s-au desfășurat cu intermitențe sub autoritatea Direcției Monumentelor Istorice între anii 1967-1988. S-a avut în vedere ca prin restaurare să se pună în valoare elementele specifice arhitecturii gotice, inclusiv refacerea etajului superior al turnului locuință, dar și modernizarea spațiilor, în perspectiva amenajării ca muzeu de istorie. În frontonul portalului de acces în clădire este încastrată o placă de marmură, cu un text care, în limba latină, menționează vizita făcută la Primărie de către împăratul Iosif al II-lea, în vara anului 1773. Adosat clădirii, cu acces la parter și etaj, se găsește un turn care a aparținut incintei a III-a de apărare a orașului. În curtea-grădină se găsește o elegantă loggie compusă din două travee. Începuturile colecțiilor muzeului aparțin perioadei de sfârșit al secolului XVIII, numeroase piese făcând parte din proprietatea fondatorului muzeului baronul Samuel von Brukenthal. Din colecțiile sale, în patrimoniul Muzeului de Istorie, sunt prezente obiecte din domeniul numismaticii, antichităților dacice și romane, precum și numeroase piese de o deosebită valoare, aparținând epocii medievale sau moderne. Dintre acestea menționăm: mecanisme aparținând diferitelor discipline ale științei și tehnicii, instrumente muzicale, obiecte ale artei decorative (podoabe de aur și argint), porțelanuri, sticlărie, textile, arme și produse de breaslă. După cel de-al doilea război mondial prin dizolvarea sau desființarea unor instituții culturale sibiene, patrimoniul muzeului s-a îmbogățit considerabil prin transferarea în muzeu a unor colecții existente în oraș (Societatea Carpatină, Camera de arme a orașului Sibiu, o parte a pieselor Muzeului Asociațiunii Astra) etc. În anul 1959, la Palatul Brukenthal, este deschisă Secția de Istorie, într-un spațiu destul de limitat în raport cu valoarea și diversitatea colecțiilor. În anul 1986, după încheierea lucrărilor de restaurare sunt deschise două expoziții, iar în luna mai 1988 este prezentat întregul circuit muzeal, după tematica obligatorie a muzeelor de istorie. În anii 1990-1992 tematica a fost complet și fundamental restructurată, insistându-se asupra particularităților istorice ale zonei. Pe parcursul circuitului expozițional permanent și în depozite sunt obiecte care ilustrează următoarele domenii: istoria străveche și veche, istoria medievală, ambele având și lapidariu, istoria modernă, apoi domeniul artelor decorative, textile (costume de epocă), produse ale diferitelor bresle sibiene, arme și armuri, feronerie, sticlărie, numismatică, bancnote, medalii și decorații românești și străine etc. Circuitul expozițional permanent cuprinde următoarele colecții: arheologie preistorică și istorie veche - 8.177 piese, colecția de obiecte medievale - 9.669 piese (arheologie medievală - 647 piese, produse de breaslă - 1.690 piese, produse textile - 1.500 piese, obiecte din domeniul științei și tehnicii - 90 piese, arme și armuri - 1.880 piese, decorații și medalii onorifice - 239 piese, produse din sticlă și faianță - 979 piese, sigilii, ștampile, matrițe, medalii și monede - 2.374 piese), colecția Tezaur - 63.435 piese, fondul de carte și periodice Carl Engber - 15.410 piese, colecția de clișee Emil Fischer - 8.050 piese, colecția de grafică documentară - 33.252 piese, colecția de istorie modernă și contemporană - 2.227 piese.","summary":"The History Museum represents one of the most impressive monuments of Gothic civil architecture bearing Renaissance elements. Originally meant to be a dwelling place, Altemberger-Pempflinger House (in the shape of a dwelling-tower), was purchased by the City Hall in 1549. From that year onwards until 1923 here functioned the City Hall, and the city Archives pertaining to the German community until 1948. The monument restoration works were conducted under the authority of the Historic Monuments Division between 1967 and 1988, with intermittences. The restoration was intended to emphasize the elements specific of Gothic architecture, as did also the rebuilding of the upper floor of the dwelling tower, as well as the refurbishment of the space with a view to turning it into a history museum. A marble plaque is embedded in front of the access gate to the building, reading in Latin the visit paid to the City Hall by Emperor Joseph II in the summer of 1773. The building with access to the ground and upper floors is adjoined by a tower that belonged to the third defence precinct of the city. In the garden-courtyard there is an elegant loggia made up of two bays. The museum collections emerged by the end of the 18th century, and many of the pieces were owned by the founder of the museum, Baron Samuel von Brukenthal. His collections pertaining to the History Museum heritage include coins, Dacian and Roman antiquities, as well as many pieces of high worth, from the mediaeval and modern ages, including: mechanisms pertaining to various disciplines of science and technology, musical instruments, decorative art objects (gold and silver ornaments), porcelain, glassware, textiles, weapons and guild’s products. After World War II, as some Sibiu cultural institutions closed or were dismantled, the museum heritage grew considerably due to the transfer to the museum of some collections existing in the city (the Carpathian Society, the Weaponry Room of Sibiu, a part of the pieces from the Astra Association Museum), etc. In 1959 at Brukenthal Palace opened the History Department, in a too narrow a space for the worth and diversity of the collections. In 1986, when the restoration works were completed, two exhibitions opened, and in May 1988 the entire museum circuit was presented, according to the compulsory themes of history museums. Between 1990 and 1992, the themes were completely and fundamentally restructured, as the historical peculiarities of the region were outlined. The permanent exhibition circuit and the storerooms include items illustrating the following fields: ancient history, mediaeval history, both with a lapidarium, modern history, as well as decorative art objects, textiles Period costumes), products of various Sibiu guilds, weapons and armours, iron artefacts, glassware, coins, banknotes, Romanian and foreign medals and decorations, etc. The permanent exhibition circuit comprises the following collections: prehistorical archaeology and ancient history - 8,177 pieces, mediaeval objects collection - 9,669 pieces (mediaeval archaeology - 647 pieces, guild’s products - 1,690 pieces, textile products - 1,500 pieces, science and technology items - 90 pieces, weapons and armours - 1,880 pieces, honour decorations and medals - 239 pieces, glassware and faience - 979 pieces, seals, stamps, dies, medals and coins - 2,374 pieces), the Hoard collection - 63,435 pieces, Carl Engber collection books and periodicals - 15,410 items, the Emil Fischer negative collection - 8,050 items, the documentary graphics collection - 33,252 items, the modern and contemporary history collection, a.s.o."},"location":{"zipCode":"550179","address":"Strada Mitropoliei nr. 2","county":"Sibiu","locality":{"name":"Sibiu","code":"143469"},"geo":{"latitude":45.796975,"longitude":24.14959,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"National","profile":{"general":"History","main":"Roman Archaeology, History, Numismatics"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_05.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"SB-II-m-A-12134"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Ministry Of Culture","partOf":"Brukenthal National Museum"}},{"code":"6966500","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d537\u0026-Muzeul-National-Brukenthal-SIBIU","contact":{"phone":["0269.217.691","0369.101.780"],"web":["http://www.brukenthalmuseum.ro"],"director":"Sabin Adrian Luca","virtualTour":["http://www.sibiul.ro/sibiu-virtual-tour/muzeul-brukenthal_8.php"],"fax":["0269.211.545"],"email":["info@brukenthalmuseum.ro"],"timetable":["Wednesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 14:00, 14:30 - 17:00","Monday, Tuesday: closed"]},"founded":"1817","name":"Brukenthal National Museum","description":{"details":"The Brukenthal National Museum in Sibiu is an institution renowned in Europe, counting among the cultural landmarks of this country.

Arta plastică este organizată într-un sediu nou, din strada Doja nr. 6, în fosta clădire a Băncii Naționale. Secția de artă se constituie în 1981, prin donația maestrului Ioan Sima, pictor născut în comuna Pericei din județul Sălaj, primind denumirea de Galeria de Artă. Până în 1985 spațiul de expunere se extinde prin construirea, în continuarea clădirii, a unor noi încăperi și organizarea expoziției de artă plastică contemporană. Printre colecțiile muzeului se numără obiecte din domeniile: arheologie (tezaurul de la Guruslău, vase ceramice din epoca bronzului, ceramică dacică de la Buciumi; piese din castrul roman de la Porolissum - Moigrad); istorie (unelte, arme, documente); etnografie și artă populară (textile și piese de port, sumane, pieptare, icoane); entomologie (lepidoptere și coleoptere); bibliotecă (9.000 volume). ----- The museum was established on the 1st of May 1951. It comprised just four rooms on the first floor of the building in 1 Crinului Street. Attempts at developing a museum had been made repeatedly. Thus, in 1880, the Museum Association in Sălaj emerged and a museum in Zalău was established with help from the Sălaj department of Astra, a museum that existed in 1926. In 1940 this institution ceased to function, and the exhibits were lost. In 1951, Mr. Vasile Lucăcel was appointed director of the new museum institution, located in 1 Crinului Street. The latter began to collect pieces and organize the permanent exhibition that opened in August 1952, and in 1956 was remade and extended, in 1965 the folk art and fine arts departments emerged in the space mentioned. The current building was given to the museum in 1969, when the new permanent exhibition emerged with three departments: ancient history, folk art and fine arts. The new museum opened its exhibitions in August 1971 and did not undergo important changes until 1986. The museum space has grew gradually. Fine arts moved to a new location, in 6 Doja Street, in the former building of the National Bank. The art department emerged in 1981, due to the donation from master Ioan Sima, a painter, born in the commune of Pericei in Sălaj county, and received the name of Art Gallery. Until 1985 the exhibition room extended by the construction, as a prolongation of the building, of new rooms and the emergence of a contemporary fine arts exhibition. The museum collections include exhibits representing the fields: archaeology (the Guruslău hoard, Bronze Age pottery, Dacian pottery from Buciumi; artefacts from the Roman camp of Porolissum - Moigrad); history: tools, weapons, documents; ethnography and folk art (textiles, costumes, thick long coats, shirt fronts, icons); entomology (Lepidoptera and Coleoptera); a library (9,000 vols.). The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.","historic":"On the 1st of May 1951 a museum was established that used to comprise just four rooms on the upper floor of the 1 Crinului Street building.

The museum complex consists of two houses located on the right and the left of the poet’s monument: the old house where the poet was born; and the new house used by the family during the interwar period. Born in 1877, Ady Endre was one of the most important Hungarian poets of the twentieth century. In 1957, thanks to the interventions of the painter Aurel Popp, the poet\u0027s birth house was turned into a museum after it had been restored. The house was built according to the traditional peasant’s dwelling. It is covered with cane and comprises three rooms. The front room is furnished as a representative clean-room. The entrance hall was a kitchen with open chimney and it is equipped with household objects. The last room is equipped with the bed, in which according to the tradition the poet was born, and a window sideboard with documents and family photos. The big or the new house has four rooms.

Iorga, “A human’s lifetime”). Inside that “new headquarters”, the dining hall and the weddings hall were installed. The building dates from the XIX century. The necessary funds were gathered due to a call launched in 1921 and to a subscriptions list. The young teachers, chosen from the best in all country’s regions and citizens (Romanians, Saxons and Hungarians) were trained in a new pedagogical, scientific and patriotic spirit for one year. Those missionaries were creating, in the rural areas, a new Romanian soul. Nowadays, the building hosts an exhibition of religious art which continues the idea of another cultural establishment - namely the Religious Art Museum, founded in 1923 by Nicolae Iorga at Valenii de Munte and left under the care of the Missionaries’ School. The exhibition includes, in its four halls, exhibits of outstanding value, beginning with wooden icons from the XVII - XIX centuries, silver and brass candleholders, wooden and metallic hand crucifixes, pectoral crucifixes, priestly garments (miter, felonion, sleeves, epitrachelion, epigonation, cingulum), chalice coverings dating from the XIX Century, gilded silver chalices, waist inkwells, old ecclesiastical books, wool carpets, kandilas. These objects were crafted in local workshops and are bearing Russian, Greek, occidental and oriental style influences. One room is dedicated to the local heritage - objects from the XVIII - XX centuries, such as: wooden icons, ecclesiastical books, chalices, worship pots, a monastery tabernacle.

It is an intense experience, unique in a museum in Romania and worth living individually, being difficult to describe in words. The concept is unique in Romania. The virtual journey takes just over four minutes and thirty seconds. Tourists are seated in a wagon similar to the miners that once entered the salt mine.

Exhibition activity and direct work with the public are carried out in nine museum sections, each with a well-defined identity from the point of view of the scientific theme and the cultural-educational functionality, while also having a judicious territorial distribution, being located both in the county main city, as well as in three geographical areas with a great cultural and tourist significance: the Museum of the Man and the Aquarium - in Ploiești, in the Palace of Culture, the Petroleum Museum - in Ploiești, the Museum of the Natural Reservation Bucegi - in Sinaia, the Salt Museum in Slănic, - Museum \"Mine Flowers\" and Anthropology Museum \"Francisc I. Rainer\" - in Cheia, Museum \"The Nature of the Teleajen Valley\" - in Vălenii de Munte, Botanical Garden - in Bucov. The uniqueness of this museum among its institutions is its profoundly educational character, having a brand assumed as MUSEUM-SCHOOL through the educational offer for pupils and preschools, but also due to the interactive presentation of the permanent exhibitions using modern exposure techniques such as augmented reality and VR technology. Besides the 9 museum sections, the museum has a National Cultural Heritage Lab and 10 patrimonial warehouses, organized as follows: Mineral Warehouse, Palaeontology Depot, Botanical Superior Plants, Botanical Inferior Plants, Old Pharmacy Deposit, Entomology Deposit, Malacology Deposit, Warehouse Vertebrates, Wet and Anatomic Paths Warehouse, Mortar and Mural Painting Store.","summary":"In 1956, due to the care of emeritus Professor Margareta Moșneaga, at Ploiești emerged the first natural sciences museum developed according to dioramatic principles, presenting the flora and fauna of the area, as well as an evolutionism department. After the 1977 earthquake, the museum has been developing with new themes upon the initiative and under the leadership of Mrs. Zoe Stoicescu-Apostolache, in collaboration with many museum specialists, research institutions, doctors, anthropologists. The museum is housed in the Palace of Culture in Ploiești, built in a neoclassical style, in 1872. After the 1977 earthquake, the building was repaired, but not consolidated, and at the present is under restoration works. It presents the geography-geology of the area between Dâmbovița and Râmnicu Sărat, an aquarium, collections of superior plants, mollusks, exotic butterflies. The permanent exhibition named \"Man\u0027s Museum\" reveals the most important aspects of human existence (anthropogenesis - anthropology, human races, sub races, anatomy, physiology, human genetics, ecology, demography, nature protection, human creativity, as well as anthropic ecosystems in Romania).

Clădirea care adăpostește expoziția permanentă a fost ridicată de bunicul poetului, Hristea Stănescu, și de cei doi fii mai mici Gheorghiță și Nicolae (tatăl poetului), in anii 1926- 1927, pe strada General Cernat nr. 2, devenită acum str.

Arhitectura ei simplă și echilibrată amintind de cea a caselor țărănești din satele de câmpie, arată că stăpânul trebuie să fi fost un om gospodar, cu simțul frumosului, știind a cântări cu măsură, dar fără zgârcenie fiecare lucru. Așezate în șir, încăperile sunt luminate de ferestre ce împart armonios orizontalitatea fațadei. Dormitorul în care a văzut lumina soarelui copilul Nini, camera de lucru a elevului, sufrageria și bucătăria sunt mobilate cu piese ce au aparținut familiei Stănescu. Câteva piese simbol se regăsesc în opera poetului: patul, pianul, biroul de lucru, cărțile fundamentale, pendula care i-a bătut ora sosirii pe lume în primăvara anului 1933, martie 31, într-o vineri, în jurul prânzului, piesă bine conservată care si acum, cu sunetul ei plăcut, măsoară trecerea timpului, tablouri, fotografii de familie.

Complexul arhitectural medieval Brebu compus din zidul de incintă, Turnul Clopotniță, Biserica și Casa Domnească, reprezintă unul dintre cele mai importante monumente istorice din secolul XVII-lea din județul Prahova. Zidul de incintă, este construit din cărămidă și piatră de râu, conferind incintei un traseu poligonal neregulat. Intrarea, se face pe sub turnul - clopotniță, construcție masivă din cărămidă, cu patru nivele și o înălțime de cca. 30 metri.  Biserica, începută la 27 iunie 1650 (7158 de la facerea lumii), în timpul domniei lui Matei Basarab și finalizată de Constantin Brâncoveanu, conform pisaniei aflată între naos și pronaos, are un plan treflat, fiind prevăzută cu trei turle. Arhitectura este inspirată de Biserica Mânăstirii Dealu (sec. XVI), decorația exterioară realizându-se cu ajutorul meșterilor munteni și moldoveni, identică cu Turnul Clopotniță. Casa Domnească, are plan dreptunghiular și ziduri groase, spațiul de locuit format din opt încăperi, terasă prevăzută cu loggie și foișor. In spațiul Casei Domnesti, Muzeul de Istorie și Arheologie al județului Prahova a organizat o expoziție de istorie și artă feudală. Sunt prezentate exponate care atestă dezvoltarea agriculturii, meșteșugurilor și comerțului în secolele XVII-XVIII, precum și înflorirea economică a Țării Românești în această epocă. În cadrul expoziției, două dintre săli sunt rezervate dezvoltării culturii, artei tipografice care cunoaște o stralucită înflorire în timpul domnitorilor Matei Basarab si Constantin Brancoveanu Sunt expuse și câteva cărți vechi românești: \"Pravila de la Govora\" din anul 1640 și \"Îndreptarea Legii\", tipărită la Târgoviște în anul 1652, considerate cărți de căpătâi pentru efortul de întocmire a unui sistem legislativ autohton; \"Biblia de la București\" din anul 1688 - monument de limbă literară românească, sau cărți realizate de mitropolitul Dosoftei și Antim Ivireanul la Snagov.

The struggle between monks and peasanys lasted until 1863, when the monastery fortunes were secularized and when the monastery was turned into an unction church, and the estates were taken over by the civil Hospitals. Later, it functioned as a sanatorium, and between 1950 and 1957 it housed an asylum for old people. This architectonic complex was restored two times: in 1843, during the reign of Gheorghe Bibescu, and between 1957 and 1959, under the patronage of the Historic Monuments Department, when the monument was brought to the original shape, and became a museum.","summary":"Northeast of Câmpina, on a plateau standing to the left of the Doftana river, there is the commune of Brebu. Brebu mediaeval architectural complex comprising the precinct wall, the Bell Tower, Church and Princely House, represents one of the most important historic monuments from the 17th century in the Prahova county. The precinct wall is built of bricks and river stones, conferring to the precincts an irregular polygonal line. The entranceway is under the bell tower, a massive brick construction, with four storeys and a height of about 30 meters. The church, begun on the 27th of June 1650 (7158 from the genesis), during the reign of Matei Basarab and completed by Constantine Brancovan, according to the legend on the nave and pronaos, has a club-shaped plan, and three turrets. The architecture is inspired by Dealu Monastery Church (16th century), the exterior decoration achieved by Wallachian and Moldavian craftsmen, identical with the Bell Tower. The Princely House has a rectangular plan and thick walls, and the lodging place comprises eight rooms, a terrace provided with a loggia and a pavilion. On the premises of the Princely House, the Museum of History and Archaeology of Prahova county organized a history and feudal art exhibition. The exhibits illustrate the development of agriculture, the crafts and trade during the 17th – 18th centuries, as well as the economic development of Wallachia at that time. Two of the exhibition halls are dedicated to the development of culture, the art of printing that flourished during the time of Princes Matei Basarab and Constantine Brancovan. The exhibits include a few rare Romanian books: “Book of Laws from Govora” from 1640 and “Straightening the Law”, printed at Târgoviște in 1652, considered to be outstanding books for the achievement of a local legal system; the Bible of Bucharest” from 1688 – a monument of Romanian literary language or books achieved by Metropolitan Dosoftei and Antim Ivireanul at Snagov.

It is worth mentioning the dioramas illustrating the interesting flora and fauna in the Ceahlău and Hășmaș - Bicaz Straits National Parks, the Mesozoic and Neozoic fossils, especially the rich collection of Oligocene fossil fish, including many holotypes (the collection comprises over 600 fossil specimens, 31 of which are new species). The Oligocene formations at Piatra-Neamț include also bivalves, gastropods, arachnids and reptiles. The paleoichtyofauna collection completes the similar collections in the Moscow, Wroclaw, Brno, Vienna, and Paris collections, and represents an important source of information on the Paratethys paleoecology from the Oligocene. The scientific collections of the museum (mineralogy-petrography, palaeontology, botany, zoology) include about 45,000 items.","historic":"It was founded as a section of the Museum of Archaeology, and, in 1961, it moved to the present premises.

Înființat în anul 1934 de către preotul Constantin Matasă, acest muzeu deține cea mai importantă colecție de ceramică eneolitică din Moldova (mil. IV-III î.Hr.). Alături de aceasta, în muzeu sunt tratate, în chip monografic, aspecte mai vechi (paleolitic și neolitic timpuriu) și mai noi (civilizația traco-geto-dacică din zonă, locuirea medievală, aspecte ale istoriei locale din epocile modernă și contemporană, activitatea muzeografică din județ ș.a.), din trecutul zonei. În primele opt săli sunt prezentate cele mai semnificative aspecte ale paleoliticului de pe Valea Bistriței și ale culturilor Starčevo-Criș, Precucuteni și Cucuteni, îmbinând expunerea de obiecte tridimensionale cu o ilustrație bogată și cu numeroase reconstituiri de complexe sau de procese ce făceau parte din inventarul de cunoștințe ale omului preistoric. Ultimei culturi amintite îi este rezervată cea mai mare parte a spațiului expozițional din primele opt săli ale expoziției permanente, raport cantitativ ce reflectă situația arheologică din teren (cel mai mare număr de situri cunoscute în zonă, printre care se remarcă cele de la Bodești-Cetățuia Frumușica, Izvoare, Traian, Ghelăiești, Târpești, Târgu Ocna-Podei, Poduri). În sălile 9-10 sunt expuse cele mai importante descoperiri ale epocii metalelor, reprezentată prin aspecte locale ale bronzului timpuriu și mijlociu (Lunca, Târpești) și prin culturile: Amforelor Sferice (materiale de la Bârgăoani, Mastacăn, Piatra-Șoimului, Piatra-Neamț), Costișa (piese din așezarea eponimă, de la Siliștea, Piatra-Șoimului, Poduri), Monteoru (Costișa și Traian) și Noua (ceramică, obiecte de piatră și de metal din așezările și necropolele de la Doina, Ciritei, Târpești, Davideni, Vânători-Neamț,). De la sfârșitul epocii bronzului și din prima epocă a fierului datează cea mai mare parte a pieselor de metal expuse în sala 10 și holul adiacent (depozitele de bronzuri de la Ruginoasa, Bozieni, Șerbești, pumnalele de tip akinakes de la Văratec, Găiceana și Petricani). Pentru Hallstatt-ul final și prima etapă a La-Tene-ului descoperirile de la Lunca și Vlădiceni documentează că aria de difuziune a aspectului cultural Canlia a inclus în secolele V-III î.Hr. și zona subcarpatică a Moldovei. În ceea ce privește civilizația dacică (prezentată în sălile 11-15) menționăm că muzeul din Piatra-Neamț a adus o contribuție deosebită la cercetarea stațiunilor din perioada clasică de la Bâtca Doamnei, Cozla și Calu (Piatra Șoimului) sau a celor daco-carpice de la Vlădiceni, Homiceni, Piatra-Neamț - Dărmănești și Lutărie, Cândești, Izvoare. În sala 16 sunt expuse materiale atribuite culturii tumulilor carpatici (de la Braniște și Nemțișor), culturii Sântana de Mureș-Cerneahov (de la Doina, și Izvoare, în special), precum și din segmentul istoric cuprins între secolele V-IX: prima parte a acestui interval este reprezentată în expoziție prin piese provenind din așezările Mănoaia, Costișa, Izvoare-Bahna, Târpești, Săbăoani, Borșeni și mai ales Davideni, (cea mai mare dintre comunitățile sătești din această perioadă documentate în spațiul est-carpatic) în timp ce pentru cea din urmă (sec. VIII-IX) cea mai mare parte a materialelor existente în colecția muzeului provin de la Brășăuți, Borniș, Izvoare-Bahna și Poiana-Dulcești. Ultima vitrină a sălii este rezervată pieselor provenind de la Piatra-Neamț-Bâtca Doamnei, unde în perioada evului mediu timpuriu a existat o tabără militară. Folosind mijloace de expunere specifice, sălile 17 și 19 ale muzeului înfățișează aspecte semnificative ale evoluției economice sociale și culturale a județului Neamț pe parcursul Evului Mediu, fiind consemnate evenimentele majore care s-au petrecut pe aceste meleaguri, la care localitățile ținutului Neamț s-au racordat. Printre exponatele cele mai importante din acest segment istoric se numără tezaurul de la Buruienești (conținând obiecte de podoabă, lingouri și monede medievale) și reconstituirea interiorului unei locuințe descoperite la Târgu-Neamț, datând din secolul al XIV-lea, cu o sobă cu cahle tip oală. Dezvoltarea economică, socială și culturală a comunităților rurale și urbane în secolele XIX-XX, cât și participarea locuitorilor județului la marile evenimente care s-au petrecut în acest timp sunt evidențiate în sălile 20-23, prin numeroase documente, fotografii, arme, medalii și obiecte de epocă. Circuitul expozițional se încheie cu sala 24, în care sunt etalate arme alb și de foc din secolele XIX și XX. Cabinetul numismatic, având două săli de expoziție, prezintă publicului vizitator monede antice și medievale, medalii, obiecte de podoabă de aur și argint, vase de metal. Din ultima categorie menționăm tezaurul de vase de aur de la Rădeni și vasele de argint din tezaurul de la Muncelul de Sus (jud. Iași). Alături de expoziția de bază, muzeul organizează numeroase expoziții temporare, sesiuni și colocvii cu caracter cultural-științific, întreprinde săpături arheologice pe care le valorifică prin publicații, se preocupă de ocrotirea patrimoniului ș.a.","historic":"The museum was found in the building of the \"Queen Mary\" National House; later it functioned in the building of the school no.1, and since 1980 in the present premises.

One of the most recent departments, “Mineralogy-Crystallography”, shelters an original “mine flowers” collection, donated by Mr Constantine Gruescu, from Ocna de Fier (Caraș-Severin county) and comprises 126 samples representing polymetal ores, iron oxides and hydroxides (hematite, magnetite, limonite), as well as quartz varieties (from the rock quartz to the Japanese macle). The most recent department is entitled “Computers” and illustrates mainly their evolution over the second half of the 20th century. The most recent department is entitled “Computers” and illustrates mainly their evolution during the second half of the 20th century. Besides the departments structuring the permanent exhibitions, the museum heritage includes a few more original collections, valorized by the temporary exhibitions, such as: calculators, typing machines, photo cameras, weather forecast tools, as well as a platform with exhibits from the field of industrial archaeology. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure."},"location":{"zipCode":"700028","address":"Piața Ștefan cel Mare și Sfânt nr. 1","county":"Iași","locality":{"name":"Iași","code":"95079"},"geo":{"latitude":47.157279,"longitude":27.58696,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"National","profile":{"general":"Science And Technology","main":"Science And Technology"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_09.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6946504_10.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"IS-II-m-A-03957.01"},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Ministry Of Culture","partOf":"\"Moldavia\" National Museum Complex"}},{"code":"6946503","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d406\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-IASI","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Valentina Drutu","position":"Muzeograf, Șef Secție"},"phone":["0232.218.383"],"web":["http://www.palatulculturii.ro"],"director":"Lăcrămioara Stratulat","fax":["0332.408.166"],"email":["contact@palatulculturii.ro"],"timetable":["closed for restoration"]},"founded":"1860","name":"Art Museum","description":{"details":"Established in 1860, it was a part of the Mihail Academy.

After the historic events of 1989, the possibility arose to initiate an official institution of national representation, The Romanian Museum of Agriculture. Without proper facilities, in the initial years it was housed at S.C. AGROMEC S.A., which offered a small exhibit space and restoration workshops (1990 - 1993). In 1993, the building \"Ambianta\" was offered for use, which was a furniture store and warehouse. With a limited budget, the building was renovated and the spaces were adapted to function as a museum, including an outdoor space to hold patrimonial objects, in time for the museum’s official opening to the public (March 25, 1996). In the year 2000, with the blessing of the P.S. Damaschin Coravu, the Bishop of Slobozia and Calarasi, the Wooden Church from the village of Poiana was placed in the park in the front of the museum. The church is an historical and architectural monument (c. XVIII), unifying the museum collections with the outdoor surroundings. The church was moved on December 17, 2000, keeping the original name \"St. Ierarh Nicolaie,\" to which was added the title \"Buna Vestire.\" It is reintroduced into the cult, after approximately 50 years, now providing all the religious services for the \"Buna Vestire\" Parish. Around the museum and the church, a park was created over the years with various horticultural species to provide a quiet oasis of rest and reflection.","summary":"Representative collections (over 8,400 pieces) for the history of agriculture.

Some transformations were undertaken in the first half of the 18th century, when it got a relevantly Baroque look, as they added a monumental staircase and a lobed balcony.  The museum collection includes pieces of archaeology (prehistoric, Dacian, Roman, premediaeval, early mediaeval): Roman reliefs from Ulpia Traiana and Micia, mining tools, smith\u0027s workshop, medical instruments, bronze pieces, coins history items, works of fine arts and decorative art, Romanian and foreign rare books, side and fire arms; ethnography items: costumes, tools, pottery of Botiza, glass icons; natural sciences items (botany, palaeontology, malacology, vertebrate entomology specimens, etc.); a library (40,000 vols.). The museum underwent reorganization in 1970, 1981 and restructuring in 1991.

Materialele adunate au fost adăpostite într-o cameră a Liceului \"Ion Maiorescu\", prin bunăvoința directorului acestuia, Savin Popescu. Pe baza săpăturilor prof. Dumitru Berciu, prin anii \u002750 s-a înființat Muzeul Raional Giurgiu, în cadrul Regiunii București, pornit de un grup de entuziaști, între care Rădulescu și Mihai Ionescu. Muzeul a început cu o colecție de științele naturii, apoi a căpătat un profil mixt, adăugându-se colecții de artă și arheologie. După 1968, odată cu reorganizarea administrativă, a devenit muzeu județean pentru județul Ilfov. În ajunul centenarului Independenței, muzeul, găzduit până atunci într-o modestă casă, s-a mutat în fosta clădire a Prefecturii, el funcționând în continuare ca secție a Muzeului Județean Ilfov. După 1990 a revenit la vechea denumire, ca muzeu județean independent. Mai are în subordine muzeul de la Florești-Stoienești. Clădirea este monument istoric, sediul fostei Prefecturi de Vlașca. Un prim corp datează din sec. al XIX-lea (1877-1878), iar în 1903 se mărește și se modernizează. Valorifică expozițional și conservă piese de istorie; arheologie: material litic din paleolitic, ceramică și idoli din neolitic, din epoca bronzului și a fierului, unelte, ceramică, podoabe, monede (13 tezaure monetare, o colecție alcătuită din 2500 de piese din aur, argint și metal comun), arme, documente din evul mediu și din epoca modernă; etnografie. Se pot vizita 8 săli la parter, care cuprind 3 săli de istorie străveche și veche; se remarcă idoli neolitici, vase antropomorfe și zoomorfe de la Sultana (cultura Gumelnița), obiecte aparținând culturii Tei. Alte trei săli sunt dedicate istoriei medievale: colecția de proiectile de artilerie din Cetatea Giurgiului, ceramică cu sgrafitto. Sălile de istorie modernă prezintă perioada de la 1821 la Alexandru Ioan Cuza: steme în marmură de pe frontispiciul unor clădiri, colecție de hărți, inclusiv planul Cetății Giurgiu de la 1790, întocmit de austrieci, achiziție recentă; presă locală, istoria Șantierului naval din Giurgiu (centenar), colecție de peste 19.000 de periodice: colecția integrală \"Resboiul\", \"Fundațiile Regale\", \"Viața Românească\", \"Flacăra\", \"Furnica\" etc., pictură (Sava Henția, Vermont, Corneliu Baba, Basarab, Theo Sion, Știubei etc.), sculptură (Romanelli), grafică (Bulgăraș); colecție de monede antice, medievale și moderne; bibliotecă, carte veche.","historic":"Legally it was founded in 1934, but it lacked a place of its own.

In 1974 the continuously growing collection was placed into a peasant house built at the beginning of the 20th century. In the next decade the collection was extended with objects from different ethnographic regions of Transylvania and Moldavia. The first exhibition was organized in 1993 with the title: \"Traditional Folk Art of Zăbala\". The first the permanent exhibion called \"The Traditional Folk Art of the Moldavian Csángós\" was opened on September 14. 2003, within a festive event. the professional inventory, administration and description of the collection was carried out step by step by the ethnography students of Babeș-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca. In 2004 Pro Museum Association was founded, the owner of the collections and the immovables. From 2005 the Museum is an external Department of the Sekler National Museum of Sfântu Gheorghe, Covasna County. In 2007 we started the accreditation process of the Museum and its inclusion into the national museal circuit of Romania. The exhibitions can be visited since 2003. The Csángó Ethnographical Museum - as a Department of the Sekler National Museum - received a preliminary notification of functioning in December 2007 from the Ministry of Culture, Cults and National Patrimony. The institution is supported by the Local Council of Zăbala, by Covasna County Council as well as by different cultural foundations. The most valuable part of this collection is represented by ceramic tiles. Among the 200 pieces we can find some from the 15th-19th century, manufactured under the influence of Rennaisance, Rococo and Classicism. The scientific research on the tiles found at Zăbala and deposited in the Museum produced several papers published in specific volumes. From the 200 pieces we managed to take stock and describe different bowls, jugs and other ceramics collected from the village and its surroundings. A part of these are the works of local craftsmen from the 18th-19th centuries, but we also have products from Corund, Mădăraș, Bârsănești, Satul Nou, Iara, Vadul Crișului, Rădăuți, Vama, Turda and Zalău. The Saxon collection of our museum was realized at the end of the 20th century, and it was exhibited in Tg. Mureș, Cluj-Napoca, Sf. Gheorghe, Sighișoara and Zăbala. It includes first of all traditional festive costumes, interior textiles, different pieces of furniture and ceramics, coming from the regions of Sibiu, Sighișoara, Țara Bârsei. With the help of these items we are able to represent the change within the Transylvanian Saxon culture and lifestyle during the 19th and 20th century. In addition to the collection of objects there is a rich photo and documentary material available. This collection of furniture represents the culture of peasant interiors from the 18th-19th-20th centuries. The most valuable items of this collection were manufactured in the 18th century. The most valuable dowry chests were painted in the 19th century. The collection hosts several pieces of furniture from the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, showing a strong influence of Secession. The interiors from the first part of the 20th century are the best documented ones, the collection containing complete pieces of furniture from several peasant houses. This collection consists of textiles related to family life, to interiors, to everyday and economic life. In the last few years we managed to collect several complete dowries from the interwar period. The Sekler costumes collected in the settlement expose a changing process from the beginning of the 20th century to our present days. Thus we can trace the evolution of the modernizing region\u0027s popular costume. The ethnographic collection of Zăbala contains numerous articles of personal and everyday use: containers, water jugs, salt cellars, hand mills, grain mortars, wood skates, hammer, grain shovel, umbrella, fire tong etc. The historic collection consists of objects related to the historic memory of the locals, different historic representations kept in private interiors. There are also objects related to WWI and WWII. We also have numerous objects, representations on the members of family Count Mikes, who had an important role in the social, economic, confessional, social and educational life of the village. The Romanian Collection of Zăbala presents first of all local interiors, different pieces of furniture, interior textiles, popular costumes from the beginning of the 20th century. We have documented the life style of a Romanian family from Zăbala through interviews, documentaries, photographs starting with 1974. This way we inherited the interiors of this family consisting of furniture, textiles, articles of personal use and festive costumes. As the major occupation of the local Romanians used to be sheperding, the present collection presents different objects related to animal keeping and milk processing in the Vrancea Mountains. The Romanian collection also contains interior textiles and traditional local costumes. We can enumerate popular costumes for men and women from the first part of the 20th century, shirts, cloaks, mantles etc. The interior textiles are represented by kerchiefs, pillowcases, bedspreads, carpets, curtains etc.Along with pieces of furniture, articles of everyday use, costumes and textiles, the Romanian collection includes objects of a memorial character: photographs, diplomas, icons etc. This collection also includes costumes, textiles, ceramics from other Romanian regions: Oaș, Făgăraș, Bistrița, Crișuri region, Banat, Sibiu, Vrancea, Bucovina. Csángó Collection was brought together by the founder of the Museum and by the results of the fieldwork carried out since 1991 by the researchers of Kriza János Ethnographical Society and the staff of the Department of Hungarian Ethnography and Anthropology of Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca. The collection presents mainly 20th century Csángó textiles, traditional interiors from Lespezi, Oituz Bacău, Pustiana, as well as the shop of potter Gabor Raymund. There are also everyday and festive costumes, furniture, musical instruments, objects and printings related to their religious life and articles of personal use, pottery from Oituz and Frumoasa. Most of the objects represent the essential moments in the sacred and the profane life of the Moldavian Csángós, from birth to death: for example there are objects related to customs, everyday life, religious life, costumes related to the rites of passage, the art of sewing, sacred objects (books, rosaries etc.), musical instruments, symbols of christening, wedding and funeral. The collection is documented with the help of an outstanding visual material. In the villages of Covasna County Gypsies are dealing with different traditional craftsmanship: burning of bricks, manufacturing of baskets and brooms, while in other settlements they are making bins of wood for grains or flower. We would like this crafstmanship diversity to be presented within our Museum especially by the products of the craftsmen from this region: tiles, brooms, baskets as well as the tools in use for the manufacturing of these.","summary":"The first collections of the Csángó Ethnographical Museum were born under the initiative of Ferenc Pozsony.

Remus Opreanu, primul prefect român din Dobrogea, și revizorul școlar Ion Bănescu adună vestigiile din Constanța și împrejurimi și le adăpostesc în clădirea Prefecturii. Micul muzeu s-a dezorganizat în 1882, din cauza unui incendiu. Monumentele salvate au fost adăpostite în \"pavilionul\" din grădina publică. După mai multe peregrinări, Muzeul de Istorie Națională și Arheologie a fost reorganizat în această formă completă în 1977. Clădirea muzeului a fost ridicată la începutul secolului al XX-lea, cu o arhitectură specific românească, pentru administrația locală. A fost cedată muzeului de către Primăria Constanța în 1977. Expune piese de arheologie preistorică, greacă, romană, bizantină și medievală: unelte de silex, ceramică, unelte și arme (din piatră, bronz și fier), elemente de arhitectură, artă sculpturală, vase de sticlă, microstatuaria din bronz, bijuterii; numismatică: monede de bronz, argint și aur, ca unicate fiind monedele scitice; istorie. În două săli amplasate la parterul muzeului sunt reunite monumentele arheologice cu valoare deosebită, rarități și unicate: colecția de statuete \"tip Tanagra\" (din epocile elenistică și romană timpurie); vase ceramice antropomorfe sau cu reprezentări dionisiace; tezaurul tomitan de sculpturi descoperit în 1962 (bustul zeiței Isis, aedicula cu dubla reprezentare a zeiței Nemesis, grupul statuar Fortuna cu Pontos, statuia Șarpelui Glicon etc.); colecția de portrete imperiale (Antonius Pius, Caracalla, Gordian III, Filip Arabul, Constantin); colecțiile de podoabe din aur (inele, cercei, brățări, pandantive, cruciulițe), geme și camee; tezaurul de vase din argint descoperit la Sucidava-Izvoarele. Etajul I al muzeului este amenajat cronologic - de la paleoltic până la evul mediu: colții de mamut de dimensiuni mari de la Poarta Albă, ceramică Hamangia; sabia miceniană de la Medgidia (secolul al XIV-lea a.Ch.) și depozitele de seceri, topoare și podoabe din bronz descoperite la N. Bălcescu, Constanța, Gura Dobrogei; statuia din calcar a unei căpetenii traco-scitice (descoperită la Sibioara) și un cazan de cult din bronz (găsit la Castelu), ambele din secolul al V-lea a.Ch.; colecția de amfore grecești și fragmente arhitectonice din marmură de la edificiile publice de epocă elenistică, descoperite la Tomis, Histria, Callatis; monumente epigrafice din cetatea de la Albești. Perioada romană este intens reprezentată prin materialele descoperite: documente epigrafice, cărămizi ștampilate, stâlpi miliari, elemente de arhitectură, unelte agricole, materiale ceramice diverse, între care se remarcă colecția de opaițe, sculptură laică, votivă și funerară - busturile unor cetățeni, un cadran solar, reprezentările divinităților Venus, Apollo, Hercule, Cybela, Cavalerul Trac, portretele și stelele funerare. Ultimele două săli ale etajului ilustrează desăvârșirea formării poporului român: locuință românească de secol X de la Capidava, reconstituită, obiecte de cult, precum și așezământul monahal de la Basarabi. Din perioada bizantină provin: colecția de monede schifate descoperite la Isaccea, ceramica, uneltele și podoabele descoperite la Gârlița, Capul Viilor (Histria), Castelu, Dinogeția etc. Pentru secolele XVII - XVIII sunt expuse arme, obiecte și carte de cult, podoabe, obiecte de uz casnic și vase ceramice smălțuite.

However, only after having won the independence, ancient vestiges became a matter of interest for the Romanian Academy and the city administration. Remus Opreanu, the first Romanian prefect of Dobrudja, and school inspector Ion Bănescu gathered vestiges in Constanța and its surroundings, and stored them in the Prefecture building. The small museum was damaged by a fire in 1882. The saved monuments were stored in the public garden \"pavilion\". After many moves, the National History and Archaeology Museum was fully reorganizedin 1977.","summary":"TThe first attempts at establishing a museum in Constanța date from the first half of the 19th century. However, the Romanian Academy and the local authorities took an interest in ancient vestiges only after the Independence War (1877 - 1878) and the integration of Dobrudja in the Romanian state. Remus Opreanu, the first Romanian prefect in Dobrudja, and the school inspector Ion Bănescu gathered vestiges in Constanța and from its surroundings and sheltered them in the building of the Prefecture. The small museum fell apart because of a fire in 1882. The rescued monuments were sheltered in the \"Pavilion\" of the public garden. After many shifts, the National History and Archaeology Museum was completely reorganized in 1977. The museum building was raised in the early 20th century, with a specific Romanian architecture for the local administration. The Constanța City Hall gave it to the museum in 1977. There are collections of prehistoric, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and mediaeval archaeology: flint tools, pottery, stone, bronze and iron tools and weapons, architectural elements, sculptural art, glass pottery, bronze statuettes, jewels, bronze, silver and gold coins (Scythian coins as unique items); history items. Two ground floor halls display the archaeological monuments of high value, rarities and unique items: the \"Tanagra\" type statuette collection (of the Hellenistic and early Roman Ages); anthropomorphous pottery or Dionysius figures; the sculpture treasure discovered in 1962 in Constanța (the bust of goddess Isis, the aedicule bearing the double figure of the goddess Nemesis, the statuette group Fortune with Pontos, the statue of the Serpent Glykon, etc.); the imperial portraits collection (Antoninus Pius, Caracalla, Gordianus III, Philip the Arab, Constantine); gold jewellery collection (rings, earrings, bracelets etc.), gems and cameos; the silver pottery treasure discovered at Sucidava - Izvoarele. The first floor of the museum is organized chronologically - from the Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages: the mammoth fangs of Poarta Albă (the White Gate), Hamangia culture pottery; the Mycenaean sword of Medgidia (14th century BC) and the deposits of sickles, axes and bronze ornaments found at N. Bălcescu, Constanța, Gura Dobrogei; the limestone statue of a Thraco-Scythian ruler (found at Sibioara) and a bronze religious kettle (found at Castelu), both from the 5th century BC; the Greek amphora collection and marble architectonic fragments from the public edifices of the Hellenistic Period, found at Tomis, Histria, Callatis; epigraphic monuments from the archaeological site of Albești. The Roman Period includes: epigraphic monuments, stamped bricks, mile pillars, architectural elements, agriculture tools, pottery - the lamps collection, lay, votive and funerary sculpture (busts, a sun dial, figures of Venus, Apollo, Hercules, Cybela, the Thracian Knight, funerary portraits and steles). The last two halls of the floor illustrate the final stage of the formation of the Romanian people: a reconstituted Romanian dwelling of Capidava from the 10th century, religious items, as well as the monastery of Basarabi. The Byzantine Age includes: the coin collection found at Isaccea, pottery, tools and ornaments found at Gârlița, Capul Viilor (Histria), Castelu, Dinogetia etc. The 17th - 18th centuries are illustrated by weapons, religious objects and books, ornaments, domestic utensils and enamelled pottery.  The 3rd floor illustrates the age between the late Middle Ages up to 1940: three-dimensional objects, original documents and photographs, books, maps, scale models. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure."},"location":{"zipCode":"900745","access":"DN 3, DN 2A (E60); DN 22 national road","address":"Piața Ovidiu nr. 12","county":"Constanța","locality":{"name":"Constanța","code":"60428"},"geo":{"latitude":44.17388,"longitude":28.658222,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"Regional","profile":{"general":"Archaeology","main":"Archaeology"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_09.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_10.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_11.jpg"]},"building":{"lmiCode":"CT-II-m-A-02831","description":"The museum building was raised at the beginning of the 20th century, having a typical Romanian architecture, for the local administration.

Ca urmare, în 1895 se constituie prima colecție publică de piese arheologice, antropologice și istorice la Buzău, expusă în una din sălile Liceului \"Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu\". Putem considera acest moment ca reprezentând nașterea primului muzeu buzoian. Prima expoziție permanentă a muzeului (cu sediul în strada Unirii nr. 145) datează din anul 1955, când patrimoniul a fost constituit din piese preluate din colecțiile școlare și din materiale provenite din săpăturile arheologice de la Sărata Monteoru și Aldeni. Din februarie 1968 Muzeul orășenesc devine Muzeu județean. Din 1971 se elaborează o nouă tematică, valorificând mai ales patrimoniul muzeal de arheologie și istorie. Tot atunci se organizează primele depozite muzeale, după criterii științifice. În anul 1980 expoziția a fost mutată în actualul sediu, fiind inaugurată la 7 iulie 1981. A suferit transformări și reactualizări în 1986 și 1990. În anul 1980 s-au deschis Secția de pictură \"Brăduț Covaliu\" și Secția de artă decorativă, conținând valoroase piese de tapiserie, sculptură, sticlă. Secțiile de arheologie și istorie dețin valoroase piese aparținând aspectului cultural Stoicani-Aldeni, culturii Monteoru, plastică geto-dacică de tip Cârlomănești, replica tezaurului de la Pietroasele - \"Cloșca cu puii de aur\" - piese aparținând epocii romano-bizantine, culturilor Sântana de Mureș, Ipotești-Cândești, Dridu. Sunt reprezentate vestigiile rupestre din Munții Buzăului, inventare arheologice din săpăturile efectuate la cetăți feudale (Vintilă Vodă, Berca, Bradu), elemente arhitectonice medievale. Colecția numismatică cuprinde 10 tezaure monetare din aur, argint și metal comun. Momentele mari ale istoriei moderne și contemporane în care a fost implicată zona Buzăului sunt înfățișate cu piese reprezentative (mobilier, documente și obiecte personale aparținând lui Nicolae Leonard, Vladimir Maximilian, Alexandru Marghiloman).","summary":"In 1891 Basil Iorgulescu demanded from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education the permission to build in Buzău a collection of archaeological and historical pieces, that had been gathered by him during more than 10 years of searches in the county. Consequently, in 1895 the first public collection of archaeological, anthropological and historical pieces emerged in Buzău, exhibited in one of the halls of the \"Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu\" High School. We may consider that moment as the birth date of the first museum of Buzău. The first permanent museum exhibition (located in 145 Unirii Street) dates from 1955, when the heritage was made up of pieces taken over by the school collections and the materials coming from the archaeological excavations at Sărata Monteoru and Aldeni. In February 1968, the town museum became a county museum. From 1971 new themes were elaborated, based especially on the archaeology and history museum heritage. Simultaneously, the first museum storerooms were organized, according to scientific criteria. In 1980 the exhibition moved to the current location, and was inaugurated on the 7th of July 1981. It underwent transformations and refurbishment in 1986, 1990 and during the recent years. In 1980 the \"Brăduț Covaliu\" painting department and the decorative art department opened, which comprise valuable pieces of tapestry, sculpture and glassware. The archaeology and history departments hold valuable pieces belonging to the Stoicani-Aldeni culture, the Monteoru culture, the Cârlomănești Geto-Dacian fine arts, the cast of the treasure of Pietroasele - \"Hen with Golden Chicken\" - pieces from the Roman-Byzantine Age, the Sântana de Mureș, Ipotești-Cândești and Dridu cultures. There are cave vestiges from the Buzău Mountains, archaeological inventories from the excavations carried out at the mediaeval fortresses (Vintilă Vodă, Berca, Bradu), and mediaeval architectonic elements. The numismatic collection comprises over ten gold, silver and common metal hoards. The great moments of modern and contemporary history when the Buzău area was involved are illustrated by representative pieces (furniture, documents and personal belongings of Nicolae Leonard, Vladimir Maximilian, and Alexandru Marghiloman). The largest telephone collection in the country comprises over 100 foreign and local pieces. The Buzău painter collection comprises paintings of Ștefan Popescu, Margareta Sterian, Adina Paula Moscu, etc. The Brăduț Covaliu collection comprises 253 works donated to the museum. Recently, the museum has acquired the Margareta and Bucur Chiriac collection.

It surrounds with an impressive wall 3 211; 4m thickness, and at approx. 12 m height, a guard road. A second precinct, lower than the other, is joined to the corridor of the arched gateway. Main enclosure wall is reinforced externally by several bastions. The interior has 275 chambers arranged in three and four levels, connected to each other by wooden ladders. Formerly, in these cellars were kept villagers’ supplies (each family had its own pantry) that sought refuge in the fortress during the siege.

Ei puneau astfel în operă testamentul cultural al lui Iacob Mureșianu, oferind statului român, în vederea organizării unui muzeu, spațiul necesar (o clădire construită în secolul XVI în stil neoclasic, declarată monument istoric), o foarte valoroasă colecție de mobilier, pictură, sculptură și mai ales, o arhivă de o inestimabilă valoare culturală, numărând peste 25.000 de documente. Muzeul este consacrat memoriei mai multor membri ai acestei familii cu mari merite în viața culturală și politică a vremii lor. După ce a fost subordonat, o perioadă, Muzeului Județean de Istorie Brașov, începând din 1998 a devenit muzeu de sine stătător. Muzeul ilustrează în special viața și activitatea poetului Andrei Mureșianu, autorul imnului de stat al României, a publicistului Iacob Mureșianu (1812 - 1887), a fiului său Aurel Mureșianu (1847 - 1909), gazetar și publicist, continuatorul tatălui la conducerea \"Gazetei de Transilvania\", și a compozitorului Iacob Mureșianu jr. Cele patru încăperi ale muzeului cuprind exponate ce ilustrează viața culturală a Brașovului din a doua jumătate a secolului al XIX-lea. La intrarea în muzeu se află o sculptură în bronz reprezentându-l pe Iacob Mureșianu-tatăl. Colecția de artă decorativă și artă plastică cuprinde piese de mobilier Biedermayer aparținând familiei, tablouri aparținând pictoriței Elena Mureșianu prima pictoriță româncă din Brașov și sculpturi lucrate de Traian Mureșianu. Arhiva Mureșenilor este una dintre cele mai bogate și importante arhive de familie. Conducând timp de mai bine de o jumătate de secol un ziar politic, Mureșenii au corespondat cu toți fruntașii politici ai vremii lor, atât din Ardeal, cât și din celelălte provincii locuite de români. Pe lângă corespondența politică, în Arhiva Mureșenilor se găsesc - sporindu-i valoarea culturală - numeroase manuscrise ale Mureșenilor și ale corespondenților ziarelor conduse de ei. Muzeul deține și o colecție de instrumente muzicale. Iacob Mureșianu (1812-1887) format la școlile Blajului, transmitea generațiilor de intelectuali ai sec. al XIX-lea mesajul cărturarilor Școlii Ardelene, potrivit căruia cultura are rolul determinant în evoluția unei națiuni, Iacob Mureșianu venea la Brasov în 1837 pentru a fi cel dintâi profesor al unei școli pe care va reusi să o transforme în ceea ce a fost Liceul latino-german și pentru a-l ajuta pe George Barițiu să redacteze primul ziar politic al românilor ardeleni. Organizarea de școli a fost o preocupare permanentă, Iacob Mureșianu reușind să pună bazele mai multor școli primare și să creeze statutele și programele de studiu în vederea înființării unor facultăți de drept și agronomie în limba româna. În 1850 devine proprietarul absolut al \"Gazetei Transilvaniei\", prin intermediul căreia a dus o luptă aprigă pentru obținerea de drepturi civice și politice pentru conaționalii săi. În semn de apreciere a laborioasei sale activități pentru unitatea culturală a tuturor românilor, în 1877 este primit în Academia Română. Andrei Mureșianu (1816-1863) la absolvirea Facultății de Teologie din Blaj este adus la Brașov de vărul său, Iacob Mureșianu, pentru a lucra împreună la formarea Liceului latino-german și pentru a redacta revista \"Foaie pentru minte, inimă și literatură\". Poet al Revoluției de la 1848, în luna mai a acelui an compune poezia \"Un răsunet\" pentru care va alege o melodie foarte mult cântată în toate provincinciile românesti, \"Din sânul maicii mele\". Lua astfel naștere \"Desteaptă-te Române\", imnul Revoluției de la 1848 și actualul imn de stat al României. Dr. Aurel Mureșianu (1847-1909), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu doctor al Facultății de Drept din Viena, renunță la o strălucită carieră juridică în capitala imperiului pentru a prelua în 1878 conducerea \"Gazetei Transilvaniei\", devenind primul ziarist profesionist din Transilvania. Foarte activ în viata politică, se află printre fondatorii Partidului Național Român, făcând parte aproape în permanență din Comitetul Central al acestuia, \"Gazeta Transilvaniei\" devenind oficios al partidului. Este autorul unuia dintre cele două proiecte care au stat la baza Memorandului din 1892 și s-a numărat printre apărători în Procesul Memorandiștilor, militând pentru dreptul fiecărui cetățean de a se putea apăra în limba maternă. Iacob Mureșianu jr. (1857-1917), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu, după doi ani de studii la Politehnica din Viena renunță pentru a se consacra muzicii. Repurtează succese remarcabile în timpul studiilor la Viena și Leipzig, dar la absolvirea Conservatorului se întoarce în țară pentru a se achita de datoria pe care consideră că o are fiecare intelectual român față de neamul sau. Întreaga creație îl plasează printre clasicii muzicii culte românești. Elena Mureșianu (1864-1924), soția lui Aurel Mureșianu, studiază artele frumoase la Viena și München. A fost prima pictoriță româncă din Brașov. Lucrate în maniera academismului german, portretele Elenei Mureșianu au, pe lângă valoarea artistică, și o mare valoare documentară. Traian Mureșianu (1864-1901), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu, bariton la Opera din Viena a fost și un foarte talentat sculptor, desfășurându-și activitatea de artist plastic la Iași. Iuliu Mureșianu (1900-1956), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu jr., continuă cu succes vocația muzicală a tatălui său, obținând în anul 1940 premiul George Enescu. În aceeași clădire este amenajat și muzeul memorial Gheorghe Dima ((1847-1925) cuprinzând obiecte, fotografii și documente aparținând compozitorului.","summary":"\"Mureșianu\u0027s House\" was set up in 1968 as a result of the donation from the Mureșianu family descendants. In this way they filled out Iacob Mureșianu`s cultural will, giving the Romanian state the necessary space, a very valuable collection of furniture, paintings, sculptures and especially an inestimable cultural archive, counting over 25,000 documents. The museum is dedicated to the memory of several members of this family with great cultural and political merits in their time. At the beginning a department of the Brașov County History Museum, the museum has functioned as an independent institution since 1998. The museum illustrates above all the life and activity of the poet Andrei Mureșianu, the author of the Romanian national anthem, of the publisher Iacob Mureșianu (1812 - 1887), of his son Aurel Mureșianu (1847 - 1909), a journalist and publisher, who continued his father as leader of the \"Transylvanian Gazette\" and of the composer Iacob Mureșianu jr. The four rooms of the museum present exhibits illustrating the cultural life of Brașov during the second half of the 19th century. The decorative art and fine arts collection includes Biedermeier pieces of furniture of the family, paintings by the painter Elena Mureșianu, the first Romanian woman painter from Brașov and sculptures by Traian Mureșianu. The Mureșianu archives are one of the richest and most important family archives. The museum holds also a collection of musical instruments. The museum has three rooms for temporary exhibitions and a documentation centre."},"location":{"zipCode":"500025","access":"Railway Station - Livada Poștei line 4; Railway Station - G.

Întrucât nu respecta structura originalului, această casă este și ea dărâmată și în 1979 se inaugurează o altă casă (construită pe temelia celei dărâmate în 1924).

Personalitate bine cunoscută în cercurile culturale arădene, Iosif Sârbuț s-a născut în 1912, într-o familie de români de lângă localitatea maghiară Gyula. Nu a avut studii de specialitate, fiind angajat la Teatrul din Arad, încă din anul 1930, în calitate de mașinist de scenă, funcție pe care a deținut-o până la pensionare. Pasionat de istoria culturală arădeană, a colecționat vreme de decenii, mii de materiale muzeale din toate domeniile culturii, dar cu predilecție cele de natură teatrală. La un moment dat conducerea Teatrului de Stat din Arad i-a oferit patru camere în incinta instituției, în care Iosif Sârbuț a organizat și condus un Muzeu al Teatrului din Arad. În 1976, aceeași conducere a desființat compartimentul muzeal ceea ce l-a convins pe colecționar să doneze colecția Muzeului Județean Arad.În 1986, colecția a fost mutată în depozitul de lângă sala \"Clio\". În perioada 1990 - 2000, au fost organizate opt expoziții temporare cu piese din colecție. Colecția se află într-un depozit amenajat în incinta clădirii de pe str. Gh. Popa de Teiuș nr. 2 - 4. Construită în 1909 ca sediu administrativ, ea a fost transformată, în 1984, în sediul secției de artă a Complexului Muzeal Arad, adăpostind, în același timp, biblioteca județeană și sala de expoziții temporare a muzeului (sala \"Clio\"). Atât sala \"Clio\", cât și depozitul (situat lângă aceasta) au fost renovate radical în 2004. Colecția cuprinde peste 25.000 piese datând din secolele XIX - XX: afișe originale în diverse formate, plachete-invitații, cataloage, cărți de teatru, reviste teatrale, muzicale și cinematografice din Arad, fotografii cu artiști ai teatrului și din spectacole, partituri muzicale manuscrise sau tipărite, diverse obiecte de recuzită teatrală, instrumente muzicale, tablouri-portrete ale unor personalități culturale arădene, costume din spectacole, aparate pre-cinematografice și cinematografice etc. Dintre acestea sunt de menționat: statutul, regulamentul de funcționare și programa de studiu a Conservatorium-lui din Arad (1833 - a șasea instituție de acest tip din Europa); afișe ale unor spectacole jucate pe scena Teatrului Vechi din Arad (1817 - primul teatru de pe actualul teritoriu al României) în perioada 1833 - 1871, dintre care se remarcă cele ale unor trupe austriece, maghiare și românești (M. Pascaly - 1868, M. Millo - 1870/71); placheta-afiș a filmului Războiul de Independență (1913 - realizat de Grigore Brezeanu), film proiectat la cinematograful Urania, amenajat în 1907 în clădirea Teatrului Vechi; filme pe celuloid realizate la Arad în 1913 (Nunta pe Strada Mare; Răzbunarea lui Napoleon); pianul la care a concertat Franz Liszt la Arad (1846) și donat de către compozitor Conservatorium-ului (pianul este expus în foaierul Palatului Cultural).","historic":"The collection is based on the 21.650 pieces gathered by Iosif Sarbut and donated to the museum in 1976.

Passioned by cultural history, he collected thousands of pieces mainly refering to theater history. At one moment in time, the administration of the local theater disposed four rooms within the theater for I. Sarbut’s Museum of the Theater. In 1976, the same administration turned the four rooms to another destination, so the collector donated his collection to the museum.

Clădirea \"Babilon\" a fost construită între 1851 - 1853, în spiritul arhitecturii romantice. A fost folosită ca pavilion de locuințe pentru ofițeri, iar în 1967 - 1968 a fost reamenajată ca spațiu muzeal. Sala Unirii a fost construită între 1898 - 1900, având inițial destinația de cazinou militar. A fost restaurată în 1922 și între 1967 - 1968. Este clădirea unde s-a votat Unirea Transilvaniei cu România. Muzeul din Alba Iulia a fost inaugurat în 1888 din inițiativa Societății de istorie, arheologie și științele naturii din Comitatul Alba Inferioară, avându-l ca director pe renumitul arheolog Adalbert Cserny (1842 - 1916). În 1929, sub egida ASTREI, a fost organizat ca Muzeu al Unirii. Bogatelor colecții arheologice li s-au adăugat piese valoroase referitoare la istoria modernă a românilor. În 1938, sub conducerea istoricului Ion Berciu, sub noua denumire de Muzeul Regional Alba Iulia, așezământul a intrat în administrația statului român. A cunoscut o amplă reorganizare în 1968, revenind la numele de Muzeul Unirii. În linii mari, forma actuală a expoziției de bază datează din 1975. În 1992 a devenit Muzeul Național al Unirii subordonat direct Ministerului Culturii.

Especially interesting are the marble statuette depicting Liber Pater, the bronze collection, the glass collection, bone, horn and ivory objects as well as the monetary hoards from Alba Iulia, Tibru, Geomal, Șpring and Medves. These include the silver hoard from Lupu and the materials discovered in the princely tomb at Cugir. The numismatic collection includes ancient, mediaeval and modern coins, plaques and coins.

Their relics and works are exhibited in the Bolyai Memorial Museum founded in 1937, in a room of the Protestant College Library. In 1955, the museum and the college library, home to 20,000 pages of manuscripts by the two Bolyais, were moved to the building of the Teleki Library. At the beginning, the Bolyai Memorial Museum belonged to the Protestant College Library (i.e. the Bolyai Library), which later merged with the Teleki Library and is today the Teleki-Bolyai Library. The museum has always been managed by the librarians. Bolyai Farkas (1775-1856) was born in the village of Bólya, Szeben County on 9 February, 1775. The family belonged to the nobility, but by the time Farkas was born they were no longer wealthy. He started his schools at the Nagyenyed Protestant College. He was considered a prodigy due to his talent in mathematics and languages. Later he transferred to the Kolozsvár Protestant College. He developed a passion for mathematics at the University of Göttingen. This is where he became a life-long friend of the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. When he returned home, he settled in Kolozsvár. He performed his inaugural address at the Marosvásárhely Protestant College on 4 May, 1804. For the next 47 years, he was professor of mathematics, physics, chemistry and astronomy at the college that today bears his name. His life work is of an extraordinary diversity; however, he was most outstanding as a mathematician. His first works treat the parallel axiom. His masterpiece, the Tentamen (Marosvásárhely, 1832) contains his reflections on the foundations of mathematics, a number of innovative thoughts ahead of his time. He originally intended his books on mathematics as textbooks. He was an outstanding theoretical pedagogue; he wrote several works calling for changes in public education. Some of the points he argued for were a more cleverly organized curriculum and practical education. Bolyai János (1802-1860) was one of the greatest personalities in the history of mathematics. He broke new grounds in science: the creation of Non-Euclidian geometry revolutionized geometry and the theory of physics and replaced Newtonian theories about the world. He was born in Kolozsvár, on 15 December, 1802. He was brought up in Marosvásárhely and attended the Protestant College. He showed a great interest in mathematics as a child. However, due to the limited financial possibilities of the family he couldn’t attend the University of Göttingen; instead, he went to the Military Academy of Vienna. The military career was a burden to him. He entered the army engineering corps and was sent to Temesvár, Arad and then to Olmütz; then, at the age of 30, he retired and moved home to Marosvásárhely. He lived a retiring life here and on his estate in Domáld, which the family had inherited from Farkas Bolyai’s mother. From a young age, János Bolyai was interested by the unsolved problems of mathematics, most of all the 9th axiom of Euclid, the Postulate of the Parallels. With hard work, he developed Non-Euclidian Geometry as early as in 1823. He wrote down his findings in his work entitled Scientia Spatii, which was only published in 1832, as an appendix to his father’s book Tentamen. One of the greatest achievements of the age, it still didn’t bring any change in Bolyai’s life. His name remained unknown for the world of science.","summary":"Marosvásárhely is the city of the Bolyais; this is where the two outstanding mathematicians, Farkas and János Bolyai spent most of their lives. Their relics and works are exhibited in the Bolyai Memorial Museum founded in 1937, in a room of the Protestant College Library. In 1955, the museum and the college library, home to 20,000 pages of manuscripts by the two Bolyais, were moved to the building of the Teleki Library.  At the beginning, the Bolyai Memorial Museum belonged to the Protestant College Library (i.e. the Bolyai Library), which later merged with the Teleki Library and is today the Teleki-Bolyai Library. The museum has always been managed by the librarians. Bolyai Farkas (1775-1856) was born in the village of Bólya, Szeben County on 9 February, 1775. The family belonged to the nobility, but by the time Farkas was born they were no longer wealthy. He started his schools at the Nagyenyed Protestant College. He was considered a prodigy due to his talent in mathematics and languages. Later he transferred to the Kolozsvár Protestant College. He developed a passion for mathematics at the University of Göttingen. This is where he became a life-long friend of the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. When he returned home, he settled in Kolozsvár. He performed his inaugural address at the Marosvásárhely Protestant College on 4 May, 1804. For the next 47 years, he was professor of mathematics, physics, chemistry and astronomy at the college that today bears his name.  His life work is of an extraordinary diversity; however, he was most outstanding as a mathematician. His first works treat the parallel axiom. His masterpiece, the Tentamen (Marosvásárhely, 1832) contains his reflections on the foundations of mathematics, a number of innovative thoughts ahead of his time. He originally intended his books on mathematics as textbooks. He was an outstanding theoretical pedagogue; he wrote several works calling for changes in public education. Some of the points he argued for were a more cleverly organized curriculum and practical education.  Bolyai János (1802-1860) was one of the greatest personalities in the history of mathematics. He broke new grounds in science: the creation of Non-Euclidian geometry revolutionized geometry and the theory of physics and replaced Newtonian theories about the world.  He was born in Kolozsvár, on 15 December, 1802. He was brought up in Marosvásárhely and attended the Protestant College. He showed a great interest in mathematics as a child. However, due to the limited financial possibilities of the family he couldn’t attend the University of Göttingen; instead, he went to the Military Academy of Vienna.

The exhibits were collected by pupils from the two villages of the commune, Cidreag and Porumbești, under the guidance of Professor Fazekas Lorand since 1972. After four years of work, collected objects were exhibited in a hall of the Cultural Centre. Parish Roman-Catholic got back the old school building. The building was restored inside and outside and was offered to host the museum. In a room we expose ethnographic artefacts (agricultural tools, the means of the processing of hemp, household items and textiles). The other room accommodates documents of the commune, furniture, household and school items, old books, teaching materials from the past and others. Higher household tools are exposed in the vestibule of the building. The museum was inaugurated on 5 June 2010."},"location":{"zipCode":"447152","access":"Road E 81; 1C; 194/A train Satu Mare - Halmeu, Halmeu station.","address":"Strada Principală nr. 52","commune":"Porumbești","county":"Satu Mare","locality":{"name":"Porumbești","code":"137835"},"administrative":"Porumbești","geo":{"latitude":47.979684,"longitude":22.978702,"target":"Muzeu"}},"collection":{"importance":"Local","profile":{"general":"Ethnography And Local History","main":"Ethnography And Local History"},"pictures":["http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_01.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_02.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_03.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_04.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_05.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_06.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_07.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_08.jpg","http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/651010_09.jpg"]},"subordination":{"supervisedBy":"Local Council"}},{"code":"650990","cimecUri":"http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1861\u0026-Gospodarie-taraneasca-muzeu-GALAUTAS-PARA-Mures","contact":{"agent":{"name":"Luncan Constantin","position":"Proprietar"},"phone":["0757.284.232"],"email":["Ionelflorinmicu@yahoo.com"]},"name":"Local Museum","description":{"details":"It is a traditional house (built in 1910) with 2 rooms and a porch; paddock with barn, summer kitchen; animal cages and other household annexes.

Over the years she noted that the traditional costume from her village is changing, shifting and evening out. Traditional garb was colorful in the past. Women and girls wore different Szekely clothes according to their age. This changed and became standardized. Slowly, the old garments remained in closets or were sold. Interestingly, in the neighboring villages this change was happening at a slower pace. Her objective was to preserve traditional garb, so she started collecting garments from the past, skirts, aprons, photographs of the past and any objects that were costume related.
