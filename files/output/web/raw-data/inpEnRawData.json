The construction was completed on the 20 September 1702 (as the inscription above the main door reads). Stephen, son of Prince Constantine Brancovan lived in the palace. Set by the lakeside, in a rectangular courtyard surrounded by strong walls, the palace has a rectangular, regular plan, having three storeys: basement (cellar), ground floor and upper floor. The cellar is remarkable due to its sizes and solidness. A central pillar divides the space into four rooms, each covered by a cupola with pendants. The ground floor comprises eight rooms for the prince\u0027s servants, while the entire upper floor used to be inhabited by the princely family. At the upper storey, on the facade looking out the lake, there is the most refined architectural element of the palace: the magnificent loggia, Venetian in style, with three arches. Nowadays it is framed by two turrets, added during the restoration from 1860 - 1880, that can be remarked due to their columns with capitals carved in stone. In addition, the turret on the east side of the palace stands on eight stone columns, with a richly decorated balustrade. The vault of the turret had been covered with mural painting with geometric and floral motifs, of which a few fragments are extant. On the upper floor, probably in the High Spatharus hall, there is a large fresco depicting, on two meter panels each, the travel of the prince to Adrianopolis, in 1703, and his encounter with the sultan. Fragments from this fresco were still extant by the middle of the 19th century, but most paintings, stuccos and interior decorations were destroyed by the Turks in 1775. The rich inlaid work mingles stylistic elements characteristic both of the Renaissance and the Baroque. Nowadays Mogoșoaia estate comprises an English park, with Italian style gardens, a courtyard where there are the palace, kitchen, ice house, gate tower (before 1702), the guest house (the 17th century, 1927 - 1936 restorations), and outside it \"N. Bibescu\" greenhouses (1890), \"St. George\" Chapel (1688), and \"Gheorghe Bibescu\" Chapel (the 19th century). The palace shelters the Liana and Dan Nasta donation, a comparative art collection (about 300 pieces).

In March 1941 the museum collection was moved to 151 Calea Victoriei. In 1944 part of the collection was hidden away to the commune of Rasnic-Dolj, where a part of them remained until October 1948.The museum moved temporarily to 3 Soseaua Kiseleff, then on the 10th of December 1956 the museum was located in Șuțu Palace, and on the 23rd of January 1959 the History Museum of Bucharest City reopened to the public. Șuțu Palace is a historic monument, dating from 1834, designed by the architects Johann Veit and Conrad Schwink, who built a Neo-Gothic palace, with four polygonal turrets and a cupola, on the ruins of an earlier construction. The central hall was finished in 1862 by the artist Karl Storck and a huge Murano mirror was set in. Upon the death of the first owner, Costache Grigore Șuțu, the palace remained in the possession of his son, Grigore Șuțu (1819 - 1893). The building had various public functions during the first half of the 20th century. It was restored between 1957 and 1958, and its original aspect was regained. The archaeology collection comprises pieces from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, the Bronze Age (the Glina II and Tei cultures), Geto-Dacian ones (from Fundeni, Snagov, Popesti-Novaci, Dealul Piscului). The largest part of the collection dates from the Middle Ages: pottery, ornaments, hoards, etc. The coin, medal and seal collection includes Ottoman, Austrian, Russian hoards, seals evoking great Boyar families, medals, plaques, badges and decorations. The document collection includes documents, the earliest dating from 1488 - 1582, the Manuc stock (in the Armenian language with Turkish characters), mediaeval, modern and contemporary documents. The map and plan collection includes almost 1,000 pieces on the history of Bucharest City, on the Balkan Peninsula, the Danube course, as well as on some boyar estates. The fine art collection includes pictures, drawings, tombstones, coats of arms. The print, etching and lithograph collection includes pictures of localities from this country and abroad, of personalities, social types, battle scenes, fairs. The museum holds a historical furniture collection and households objects, a weapon collection, uniforms, flags, costume collection and textile objects (clothes, fabric samples dating from the 16th - 19th centuries, ornaments, carpets, pillows, curtains, belts, some of them discovered during archaeological excavations), the religious collection (icons, triptychs, crosses from the 17th - 19th centuries), as well as a library with 45,000 items, almost entirely literature on Bucharest.

The European Art Gallery, Romanian Old Art Gallery, Romanian Modern Art Gallery sum up works displayed in an attractive modern manner, and any visit is a pleasant, interesting way to spend time. The history borne by the building makes the visit a travel in time, as on the place where the Kretzulescu wings stands today, the boyar Dinicu Golescu raised, between 1812 and 1820, a house of impressive size for the contemporaries. During the time of Alexandru Ioan Cuza the building turned into a princely lodging, and during the time of Charles I, a winter palace. The king adorned it after his taste and was also involved with developing a painting collection, today the core of the European Art Gallery. The palace underwent a stage of modifications during the time of Ferdinand and Charles II, and its changed in 1948, when it was decided to open here a museum of art and the reception halls of the central body were assigned to the State Council. During the events of December 1989, eighty per cent of the building was damaged, and over 1,000 works of art were deteriorated or destroyed. In 1990 the building in Revolution Square turned into the National Museum of Art of Romania. The European Art Gallery, sheltered in the Kretzulescu wing, reflects, due to the distribution of the 300 works, the main art schools of Europe between the 14th and 19th centuries. From the late Gothic and the Renaissance, continuing with Mannerism and Caravagism, up to the Baroque and Rococo patterns, Italian painting is represented by works of the masters Domenico Veneziano, Jacopo Bassano, Bronzino, Jacopo Tintoretto, Luca Giordano, Orazio Gentileschi, Jacopo Amigoni. The German art collection illustrates the German version of the international Gothic or the north Renaissance pattern due to remarkable works by Bartholomäus Zeitblom, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans von Aachen. Religious fervour and burning temperament characterize the Spanish paintings by El Greco, Francisco Zurbarán, Alonso Cano, Antonio Pereda. Realism, the mystery of the light and shade or the epic picturesque of the scenes can be found in the works of Flemish artists (Bartholomäus Spranger, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Pieter Paul Rubens, David Ryckaert III) and Dutch artists (Rembrandt Harmensz, Van Rijn, Jan Davidsz, De Heem). The French art halls are spanned by works from the 16th - 19th centuries. Important artists include: J.B. Oudry, Nicolas de Largillière, Gaspar Dughet, Joseph Parrocel, next to Claude Monet, Paul Signac, Alfred Sisley. The sculpture collection includes remarkable creations by Auguste Rodin, Antoine Bourdelle, Jules Dalou and Camille Claudel. The Romanian Old Art Gallery includes 900 pieces offering a unitary image upon the cultural life in the historical provinces: Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania from the 14th - 18th centuries. Remarkable are the fresco fragments (those from Curtea de Argeș [Argeș Court] - 1526) and the icons (Wailing the Lord) - the 15th 16th centuries, Saints Simeon and Sava - 1522 - 1523, both from the monastery of Curtea de Argeș, the Virgin with Child surrounded by prophets - the second half of the 16th century, Pangarati monastery), embroideries (Epitaphs of Cozia Monastery - 1395 -1396 and of Neamt Monastery - 1437, the Air of \"St. Nicholas of Rădăuți\" Church - about 1493, the Stoles of Tismana Monastery - early 16th century), manuscripts (the Four Gospels, achieved in a Byzantine workshop, whose text dates from the 12th century, the Four Gospels of Gavril Uric - 1436 - 1437, the Four Gospels of monk Dimitrie Gramaticul - 1512), gold and silver items (the censer from Tismana - 1508-1512, the shrine from Hurezi - 1691 -1692, the precious metal vessel with artistic incrustations from Precista Monastery in Bacău - 1491 - 1496, the procession cross from Slatina Monastery - 1558), wooden and stone sculptures (the imperial doors from the church in Cârligul (Bacău) - early 16th century, the rib with the coats of arms of Moldavia from \"Three Hierachs\" in Jassy, 1637 - 1638). The gallery includes a Treasure to which three halls are dedicated, where one can see secular and religious items out of precious metals and stones, jewels and costume accessories from the 14th - 19th centuries. The Romanian Modern Art Gallery reconstructs due to the 700 paintings and sculptures the path of Romanian art from early 19th century - illustrated by the departure from the religious art of Byzantine inspiration - to the age of the great classics of Romanian art. The two centuries of art, revealed by numerous artistic trends and tendencies, are represented both by famous names, relevant for the entire Romanian culture, and by less known outstanding artists included for the first time in the permanent exhibition of the National Gallery. The tradition of portraits and the formalism of the \"painters of thin\" are illustrated in the Gallery by the works of Anton Chladek, Giovanni Schiavoni, Iosef August Schoefft, while Theodor Aman\u0027 and Gheorghe Tattarescu\u0027s paintings show how these two artists gave Romanian painting a new interpretation of academicism and neoclassicism. Outstanding personalities of national art like Nicolae Grigorescu, Ioan Andreescu, Ștefan Luchian, Nicolae Tonitza, Theodor Pallady, Gheorghe Petrașcu, Constantin Brâncuși, Dimitrie Paciurea, Corneliu Baba, Alexandru Ciucurencu, Ion Țuculescu, many other artists complete the general configuration of the represented period, including: Iosif Iser, Camil Ressu, Francisc Sirato, Ștefan Dumitrescu, Ion Jalea, Jean Al. Steriadi, Nicolae Darascu, Samuel Mützner, Petre Iorgulescu Yor, Dimitrie Gheață, Rudolf Schweitzer-Cumpăna, Lucian Grigorescu, etc. The constant tendency of Romanian culture to intertwine with European trends is revealed in the Romanian modern art exhibition by the vanguard works of Victor Brauner, Marcel Iancu, Hans Mattis-Teutsch, M. H. Maxy, Arthur Segal. One of the halls of the gallery is dedicated exclusively to the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși and gathers youth and maturity works, such as: Ordeal, Child\u0027s Head, Sleep, Prometheus, Prayer, Danaid, Silence of the Earth.","director":"Călin Stegerean","e-mail":["national.art@art.museum.ro"],"fax":["021.312.43.27"],"istoric (engleză)":"Founded under the name of ethnography museum of national art, decorative and industrial art; it was reorganized in the present building in 1953.","județul":"București","latitudine":"44,439822","localitatea":"BUCUREȘTI","longitudine":"26,095978","ordinul de acreditare":["O.M.C.C. nr. 2058/07.02.2008"],"profilul principal (engleză)":"Art","programul (engleză)":["11:00 - 19:00 (summer)","10:00 - 18:00 (winter)","Monday, Tuesday: closed last weekend of every month opened until 22.00"],"telefon":["021.313.30.30","021/314.81.19"]},{"URL":["http://www.geology.ro/"],"access (engleză)":"Underground line, Victoria station; bus: 205, 300, 381, 783","adresa":"Șos.

The museum collections constantly grow due to donations, acquisitions and new archaeological finds. The collection of metal and precious or semiprecious stones from the modern age of the history of Romania often reflects new preferences and tastes, prevailing trends of western decorative styles and manners. The exhibits reveal above all the historic value, their direct link to events and outstanding personalities of Romanian political life, including: personal belongings and authority tokens of Alexandru Ioan Cuza and King Charles I; the crowns of Queens Elisabeth and Mary; the sceptre worn by King Ferdinand, in October 1922, when he was crowned as sovereign of Greater Romania; the sceptre of King Charles II; the gold and platinum jewels with precious and semiprecious stones from the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.   In a newly built building body there is the Lapidarium, comprising, on two levels, Greek, Roman and mediaeval monuments. The first level is reserved exclusively to the cast copy of Trajan’s Column, achieved at the scale 1:1 after the original Column in Rome.

Most of the items are on open display and there are no DO NOT TOUCH notices. Labels are avoided. The museum is experimental in nature and is constantly trying new ways of presenting its collections. One of the most radical consists of painting parts of the building with a fresco finish and scratching symbols and messages on to the painted surface. There are Donors\u0027 Days, on which peasants who have given objects are invited to the museum to set up a display and are presented with specially-designed certificates.

Spiru Haret had the idea of founding such a museum, that was established on the 1st of October 1906 as an autonomous folk art museum: the Museum of Ethnography, National Art, Decorative and Industrial Art located in the building of the former Treasury. The outstanding art historian Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was appointed director. He conferred a prestigious scientific and cultural status to the institution, and changed its name first to the Museum of Ethnography and National Art, and in 1912 to the Museum of National Art. In 1931 the folk art exhibition was inaugurated. In 1953 it moved to the Știrbei Palace building, in Calea Victoriei, where it functioned for 25 years, under the name of the Museum of Folk Art of the Republic, under the leadership of Tancred Bănățeanu, a remarkable ethnographer. In 1978 it merged with the Village Museum under the name of the Village and Folk Art Museum. In 1990 the museum, bearing the current name, returned to the former premises. The building, listed as a monument of architecture, sheltering the Romanian Peasant Museum, was built by the architect Nicolae Ghika-Budești, a brilliant representative of the Romanian architecture school.  The museum presents costumes, pottery, furniture, wooden and glass icons, xylographs, religious items, fabrics, carpets, tools, as well as an important collection of foreign folk art, emerged due to the endeavours of the ethnographer Tancred Bănățeanu. All the collections include about 90,000 items, 70,000 artefacts from the old collection and 20,000 acquired after 1990. The display of the permanent exhibition is innovative and original. After 1990 six wooden churches in danger from the Arad and Hunedoara counties were acquired, four of them conserved \"in situ\", and two, in the museum precinct.

The rich archaeological collections were further enriched by valuable artifacts belonging to the modern history of the Romanians. In 1938, under the lead of the historian Ion Berciu, the settlement came to be managed by the Romanian state, but with a changed name: the Alba Regional Museum. In 1968 it underwent an ample reorganization, returning to its former name. Generally speaking, the present-day form of the main exhibition dates from 1975.

The Golescu Mansion, built in 1640, is a historic monument and it was restored between 1942 and 1943. In the Golescu Mansion there are on display memorial items: period furniture, personal belongings of the Golescu family, manuscripts; folk art: interiors, costumes, pottery. The open air department comprises folk architecture and technology, vinegrowing facilities.  Golescu mansion, located today on the territory of Ștefănești town, is the only secular fortified residence south of the Carpathians, representative for the period before the architecture of Brancoveanu style. Founded in 1640 by nobleman Leurdeanu Stroe, the mansion was destroyed by fire. In 1716 was restored and expanded in the late 18th century by Radu Golescu. The complex entered the cultural circuit 75 years ago, after a long process of restoration. Before the inauguration in 1943, the rooms were furnished with pieces donated by descendants of Golescu noble family. Also, original paintings of members of the family, painted by C. D. Rosenthal, were made available to the painter Nicolae Grant to be copied and then exposed the mansion. Important was the donation of Library \u0027I.I.C. Bratianu \u0027in Bucharest, which consisted of a large number of antique books, kept today in the museum. Access to the complex is through a fortified entrance pavilion, built of wooden wall at the bottom and the top, which served as a place for surveillance and security. It is said that Tudor Vladimirescu lived here between 18 and 21 May 1821 before being caught and killed in command of Alexander Ypsilanti. Right at the entrance, on the right, is the room of civic school, founded by the great Ban Radu Golescu in the early 19th century. The school, which taught the village children, functioned until 1821, and five years later was re-opened by Golescu as a secondary boarding school. This was the first modern school with tuition in Romanian and worked until 1830. In the former school both furniture and old books are exposed. From the epoch of Radu Golescu dates and a hospital of the poor, called \"infirmary\", located to the left of the entry into the museum complex. Another interesting building, which dates from the early 19th century, is the Turkish steam bath. The building has thick rectangular walls made of brick and mortar. The ceiling is built of brick vault and is provided with holes for ventilation. The main building, located in the center of the fortified enclosure, was built over a basement area of almost 250 square meters, with nearly a meter thick walls. One of the two rooms in the cellar has a \"vault\" where owners could take refuge in case of danger. The mansion has undergone over time, a number of changes and additions. The building, rectangular, was originally conceived with a single level dwelling, having raised floor about two meters above the ground and four slopes roof, made of shingle. Inside, the rooms are arranged around a central hall, equipped with a spiral staircase, wooden, giving access to the floor where was a ball room. The whole complex was restored in 2015-2016 and reopened to the public in summer 2016.  The museum of fruit growing and vine growing comprises three complementary sectors. The most important sector is that of peasant households brought from the main vine growing and fruit growing zones of the country, grouped under the form of a Romanian village figuring the country contour, and the chain of the national historical provinces. Each vinegrowing and fruit growing household incorporates both the home, and all the adjoining constructions and the specific tools. The second sector is made up of the facilities and tools characteristic of the main trades outside the households, such as: the pubs, the hill mansions etc. The third sector will be organized in a specially built pavilion, illustrating the history of the fruit growing and vinegrowing in Romania, from ancient times up to the present day, on the basis of the archaeological, numismatic, epigraphic, and historical documents evidence. Until now have been arranged 25 vine growing and fruit growing complexes, each comprising between three and seven adjoining constructions, as well as 14 constructions pertaining to the facility sector outside the households, that together with the houses and the other constructions are over 140 constructions. Most constructions pertaining to the open air museum of fruit growing and vine growing date from the 18th and the 19th centuries. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.","director":"Filofteia Luminița Pally","e-mail":["cmngolesti@yahoo.com"],"fax":["0248.265.148"],"județul":"Argeș","latitudine":"44,839464","localitatea":"GOLEȘTI","longitudine":"24,963463","ordinul de acreditare":["O.M.P.C.N. nr.2288/08.06.2012"],"profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography, History","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 17:00 (summer)","9:00 - 16:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"],"telefon":["0248.266.364"],"unitatea administrativă":"ȘTEFĂNEȘTI"},{"URL":["http://curtea-de-arges.com/tur-virtual-muzeu-curtea-de-arges/","http://www.primariacurteadearges.ro/portal/arges/cda/portal_cda.nsf/AllByUNID/0000112E?OpenDocument"],"access (engleză)":"close to Olari Church of the Monastery","adresa":"Str.

Until 1991 the Memorial House was patronized by the Botoșani Museum, since 1991 - 1992 it has been under the Culture Inspectorate of the Botoșani county. In 1992, it became the \"Mihai Eminescu\" National Studies Centre.

It underwent reorganization in 1985 so that it should illustrate the history of the county on a national level. The museum occupies a building representing an architectonic monument, built in 1870, that over the time had various destinations (hotel - restaurant, other public utilities). The building was badly damaged by the earthquake from May 1990 and was restored. The archaeology department presents its collections by sites, which offers two advantages: on the one hand, the visitor can look at all the vestiges of a community and can develop a full image upon its occupations and lifestyle; on the other hand, the evolutional process becomes more and more obvious, as one can notice the changes in all fields, from artefacts to spiritual life.

Consequently, in 1895 the first public collection of archaeological, anthropological and historical pieces emerged in Buzău, exhibited in one of the halls of the \"Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu\" High School. We may consider that moment as the birth date of the first museum of Buzău. The first permanent museum exhibition (located in 145 Unirii Street) dates from 1955, when the heritage was made up of pieces taken over by the school collections and the materials coming from the archaeological excavations at Sărata Monteoru and Aldeni. In February 1968, the town museum became a county museum. From 1971 new themes were elaborated, based especially on the archaeology and history museum heritage. Simultaneously, the first museum storerooms were organized, according to scientific criteria. In 1980 the exhibition moved to the current location, and was inaugurated on the 7th of July 1981. It underwent transformations and refurbishment in 1986, 1990 and during the recent years. In 1980 the \"Brăduț Covaliu\" painting department and the decorative art department opened, which comprise valuable pieces of tapestry, sculpture and glassware. The archaeology and history departments hold valuable pieces belonging to the Stoicani-Aldeni culture, the Monteoru culture, the Cârlomănești Geto-Dacian fine arts, the cast of the treasure of Pietroasele - \"Hen with Golden Chicken\" - pieces from the Roman-Byzantine Age, the Sântana de Mureș, Ipotești-Cândești and Dridu cultures. There are cave vestiges from the Buzău Mountains, archaeological inventories from the excavations carried out at the mediaeval fortresses (Vintilă Vodă, Berca, Bradu), and mediaeval architectonic elements. The numismatic collection comprises over ten gold, silver and common metal hoards. The great moments of modern and contemporary history when the Buzău area was involved are illustrated by representative pieces (furniture, documents and personal belongings of Nicolae Leonard, Vladimir Maximilian, and Alexandru Marghiloman). The largest telephone collection in the country comprises over 100 foreign and local pieces. The Buzău painter collection comprises paintings of Ștefan Popescu, Margareta Sterian, Adina Paula Moscu, etc. The Brăduț Covaliu collection comprises 253 works donated to the museum. Recently, the museum has acquired the Margareta and Bucur Chiriac collection.

The building was raised in 1860 by the architect Grigore Pongracz, and the owner of the building was the nobleman (Baron) Nalaczi Carol. Initially, the building was supposed to be the \"Green Wood\" Restaurant and Hotel, but during the interwar period the name of the building changed into \"Europe\" Restaurant and Hotel. After World War II the building became state property, and kept its profile, receiving new names, such as: \"Red Flag\" and later \"Someș\". In 1997 the museum was removed from the initial location - the Franciscan Monastery Clauster - and due to a decision of the Dej Local Council moved to the current building. The history of the museum was dramatic. In 1899 the members of the \"Society for Literature, History and Ethnography of the Solnoc-Dăbâca District\" lay the foundation for a museum collection comprising 3,791 archaeology, art and ethnography items at the State High School in Dej. In 1900, following a inspection from the Inspectorate for Museums, it ceased to function because of inadequate maintenance and operation conditions. Until 1904 the materials were transferred to the Transylvanian Museum in Cluj and to the Fine Arts Museum in Budapest. In 1925 the City Council took the decision to establish a small communal, and in 1932 the \"Dej City Museum and Library Regulations\" were signed. On the 8th of September 1940 the city was invaded by the Horthy troops, that stormed the museum, and the manager Liviu Deac was forced into refuge. Upon his return, in 1944, he tried to recover the remains spread in the museum, but the Komintern authorities burned a part of the museum and rare book heritage. Between 1952 and 1953 the heritage moved to the ground floor of the Prefecture (in the current City Hall). In 1968 the museum rose to the municipal rank and succeeded in extending to the building of the old City Hall, but in 1974, under unsafe conditions, it was forced into moving to another place, in the wet semi-basement of the Franciscan Clauster. The fine and decorative art collection includes paintings and sculptures carried out by the students of the \"Nicolae Grigorescu\" Institute for Fine Arts in Bucharest, as they were donated to the museum in 1971, due to Professor Raoul Șorban, Ph.D. The archaeology collection comprises archaeological finds achieved on the territory of Dej City, and nearby. Most artefacts include Roman inscriptions (votive and funerary altars), architectonic fragments, water feed pipes, pottery fragments, lamps, weapons, coins and other items. All these artefacts were uncovered in the Roman camp of Cășeiu - Samum, 6 km away from Dej.

Until 1904 the items were housed in the Cluj Transylvanian Museum and the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts. In 1925 the town council made the decision to found a small museum, and in 1932 they signed the \"Regulations for the Museum and Library of the Town of Dej\". In 1940 the town was invaded by Hungarian troops who devastated the museum, and the manager Liviu Deac was forced to flee. On his return in 1944 he tried to put together the scattered remains of the museum, but the communist authorities burned a part of the museum heritage and old books. In 1952-1953 the collection moved to the ground floor of the Prefecture (the present town hall). In 1968 the museum extended to the old town hall, but in 1974 it was forced to move to totally inadequate premises.

Founded in 1951, from the very beginning the museum benefited from earlier collections: a small part of the curiosities collections, silverware, pieces of furniture and European fine arts, coming from the Transylvanian Museum, and above all the collection known under the name of \"Virgil Cioflec Picture Gallery\". Virgil Cioflec (1876 - 1948) donated his Romanian art collection to the University of Cluj (1929 - 1930). The opening to the public of the Virgil Cioflec picture gallery (1933) meant the opening in Cluj of the first modern Romanian art museum whose successor became the Cluj National Art Museum.  Created with the passion and competence of the connoisseur who can appreciate consecrated values (Nicolae Grigorescu, Ștefan Luchian, Dimitrie Paciurea), and support open-mindedly authentic talents (Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu, Vasile Popescu, Jean Al. Steriadi, Lucian Grigorescu, Oscar Han, Cornel Medrea), the Virgil Cioflec Collection also nowadays stands for the relevant core of the Cluj National Art Museum heritage. The museum collections enriched in the following years as transfers, donations, and acquisitions poured in. The works of art transferred by the Ministry of Culture, the Bucharest National Art Museum, and the local Administration (Barbu Iscovescu, Constantin David Rosenthal, Theodor Aman, Gheorghe Tattarescu, Gheorghe Panaitescu Bagdasare, Carol Popp de Szathmáry, Ioan Andreescu, Karl Storck) were completed by a significant collection coming from the Cluj Subsidiary of the Romanian Academy (1971). This collection made a strong impact on the heritage as it comprises important works of art from Transylvania (unknown painters from the 18th - 19th centuries, Franz Neuhauser, Joseph Neuhauser, Franz Anton Bergman, Koreh Sigismund, Szathmari Gati Sandor, Simo Ferenc). The upper floor halls display the National Gallery. In 1990, the National Gallery was closed to be reorganized.

The plans of the construction are identical to the ones of the Institute of Zoology from Naples, and were built around 1912. Made in 1859, as a department of the museum, the Zoological Museum of the University of Cluj, has gradually increased its collections, counting now over 200.000 pieces. A special role had the Cross-African Romanian Expedition in 1971, at which took part also researchers from Cluj. The result of this expedition was the increased number of animal species with enriched the dioramas that presents the animals in their own environment. The museum contains several scientific animal collections (Biltz malacological collections; Frantzenau lepidoptera collection; Radu isopoda collection). Judging by the scientific value and the number of species detained, the museum is situated on the second place, after \"Gr. Antipa\" Museum from Bucharest. The museum is organized in three areas: the main exhibition, which includes a large number of vertebrates, exposed isolated or in dioramas and microdioramas that look similar to their natural habitat; scientific collections, that contain over 300,000 animal exemplars (the majority being insects) and which are accessible only to specialists; and the museums reserve, used for completing the exhibition and exposed only temporary. The main exhibition is the one from the museum, accessible to the public and to biology students, and occupies almost all the space.  The exhibits are presented in more forms of conservation: stuffed, dried, put in conserving liquids, and skeletons. Exposed examples are arranged in philogenetical order to reflect the evolution of the animal reign but also in dioramas, thus showing the interrelationships between species that form the animal world.  Besides local species, a large part represents exotic fauna, like, for example, the coral collection, pearl shells (Meleagrina margaritifera), the African scorpion (Pandinus imperator), the migrating Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexipus), a large variety of sea stars, Dipnoi fish, the electric African fish (Malapterurus electricus); Saint Peter\u0027s hand fish (Zeus faber mauritanicus), the surucucu snake (Lachesis atrox), a sea snake specie (Pelamis bicolor), collared bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), the desert hen (Sierraptes paradoxus), the paradise bird (Paradisea apoda), the toucan (Ramphastos toco), the kangaroos (Protemnodon rufogrissea), the racoon (Procyon lotor), the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), the mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), big cats (Felis leo, Felis tigris, Panthera onça) and many others.  Also animals representing endemically rarities are exposed, extinct species, or endemics as nautilus (Nautilus sp.), primary era relic, which can be found only in the Pacific Ocean, (Lymulus polyphemus), the only present form of the long lost groups of trilobites, a fish called asprete (Romanychtis valsanicola), that is found only in the waters of Vâlsan river and some of its streams, tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), that lives in New Zeeland, and is related with the prehistoric reptiles, the kiwi bird (Apterix oeweni), also from New Zeeland, the fan-pigeon (Goura victoria), bearded eagle and the bald eagle (Aegypius monachus), both species being extinct from our country’s fauna, the platypus (Ornithorhychus anatinus) and the echidna (Zaglosus brujnei) from Australia. The behavioural aspects of animal life are revealed in more ways. For example in thematic insectariums are shown the size variations of butterflies through out the rain and the dry seasons, aspects of mimetic and protective coloration at butterflies and maggots and also stages in the development process of the silkworm (Bombix mori).  The diorama that shows the life of reed birds and their types of nests and also the diorama with the fauna of the Bărăgan plain, builds a suggestive informational zone. The same goes to the fly birds that capture attention by the change of colours when moving in the light and changing diet. A distinctive interest is also for the kangaroo diorama (Oriolus oriolus). In here being well presented the sexual different coloration as well as the way of choosing the spot were the nest is to be built. A great diorama is one in which the fight for existence during the winter period is presented in a forest, which is in the same time on a very well documented location. As for the scientific collections, they are deposited in a specially designed room for representing the results of a life-times work of some researchers part of them being former professors or students of the university. There are also some thematic collections exposed in the halls of the museum. But part of these collections does not have scientific documentation anymore due to the fact that two World Wars have passed over the museum.  A simple reminder of the most important would be appropriate.","e-mail":["dceuca@biolog.ubbcluj.ro"],"județul":"Cluj","latitudine":"46,763989","localitatea":"CLUJ-NAPOCA","longitudine":"23,579971","profilul principal (engleză)":"Natural Sciences - Zoology","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 15:00","Saturday: 10:00 - 14:00"],"telefon":["0264.595.739 (int.121)"]},{"access (engleză)":"DN 2A road","adresa":"nr. 328","anul înființării":"1961","categoria (engleză)":"County museum","codul SIRUTA al localității":"63054","codul entității muzeale":"7026502","codul poștal":"907280","coordonatele":"localitate","denumirea (engleză)":"\"Dinu and Sevasta Vintilă\" Art Museum","descrierea (engleză)":"Paintings (Andreescu, Băncila, Grigorescu) and sculptures (Paciurea, Medrea).","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The museum was organized in the former home of the parents of the donor, dr.

However, the Romanian Academy and the local authorities took an interest in ancient vestiges only after the Independence War (1877 - 1878) and the integration of Dobrudja in the Romanian state. Remus Opreanu, the first Romanian prefect in Dobrudja, and the school inspector Ion Bănescu gathered vestiges in Constanța and from its surroundings and sheltered them in the building of the Prefecture. The small museum fell apart because of a fire in 1882. The rescued monuments were sheltered in the \"Pavilion\" of the public garden. After many shifts, the National History and Archaeology Museum was completely reorganized in 1977. The museum building was raised in the early 20th century, with a specific Romanian architecture for the local administration. The Constanța City Hall gave it to the museum in 1977. There are collections of prehistoric, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and mediaeval archaeology: flint tools, pottery, stone, bronze and iron tools and weapons, architectural elements, sculptural art, glass pottery, bronze statuettes, jewels, bronze, silver and gold coins (Scythian coins as unique items); history items. Two ground floor halls display the archaeological monuments of high value, rarities and unique items: the \"Tanagra\" type statuette collection (of the Hellenistic and early Roman Ages); anthropomorphous pottery or Dionysius figures; the sculpture treasure discovered in 1962 in Constanța (the bust of goddess Isis, the aedicule bearing the double figure of the goddess Nemesis, the statuette group Fortune with Pontos, the statue of the Serpent Glykon, etc.); the imperial portraits collection (Antoninus Pius, Caracalla, Gordianus III, Philip the Arab, Constantine); gold jewellery collection (rings, earrings, bracelets etc.), gems and cameos; the silver pottery treasure discovered at Sucidava - Izvoarele. The first floor of the museum is organized chronologically - from the Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages: the mammoth fangs of Poarta Albă (the White Gate), Hamangia culture pottery; the Mycenaean sword of Medgidia (14th century BC) and the deposits of sickles, axes and bronze ornaments found at N. Bălcescu, Constanța, Gura Dobrogei; the limestone statue of a Thraco-Scythian ruler (found at Sibioara) and a bronze religious kettle (found at Castelu), both from the 5th century BC; the Greek amphora collection and marble architectonic fragments from the public edifices of the Hellenistic Period, found at Tomis, Histria, Callatis; epigraphic monuments from the archaeological site of Albești. The Roman Period includes: epigraphic monuments, stamped bricks, mile pillars, architectural elements, agriculture tools, pottery - the lamps collection, lay, votive and funerary sculpture (busts, a sun dial, figures of Venus, Apollo, Hercules, Cybela, the Thracian Knight, funerary portraits and steles). The last two halls of the floor illustrate the final stage of the formation of the Romanian people: a reconstituted Romanian dwelling of Capidava from the 10th century, religious items, as well as the monastery of Basarabi. The Byzantine Age includes: the coin collection found at Isaccea, pottery, tools and ornaments found at Gârlița, Capul Viilor (Histria), Castelu, Dinogetia etc. The 17th - 18th centuries are illustrated by weapons, religious objects and books, ornaments, domestic utensils and enamelled pottery.  The 3rd floor illustrates the age between the late Middle Ages up to 1940: three-dimensional objects, original documents and photographs, books, maps, scale models. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.","director":"Traian Cliante","e-mail":["minaconstanta@gmail.com"],"fax":["0241.618.763"],"istoric (engleză)":"The first attempts at founding a museum at Constanța date from the first half of the last century.

Many constructions have not only an architectural value, but also a documentary one due to their inscriptions. The gates are exceptional pieces in Maramureș. The gates used to be social tokens of the owners.

After 1945, the museum grew in importance and developed its research area, as the Museum of the Iron Gates Region. On the 15th of May 1972 the museum opened under the present display having two departments: history and natural sciences with an aquarium presenting Danubian fish species. Later on ethnography and art departments emerged.  The exhibits illustrate the fields: natural sciences (fauna and flora, an aquarium for the Danubian fauna and exotic fish), history, documents, archaeology (including prehistoric finds from Schela Cladovei, Roman finds from Drobeta and lapidarium), numismatics, ethnography (costumes, pottery, textiles from Mehedinți and the Iron Gate areas), Romanian fine arts (many works, even masterpieces, signed by great painters, such as Luchian, Petrașcu, Pallady, Tonitza, Dimitrescu, Șirato, Stoenescu, Iser, Ressu). The history - archaeology department comprises nine halls: Prehistory - the vestiges of the material and spiritual life of the Schela Cladovei culture, the Geto-Dacian Civilization, the Daco-Roman Wars, Roman Ancient Monuments (the bridge at Drobeta from the years 103 - 105), Mediaeval History, the Modern Age, Romanian Feudal Art and the Contemporary Age. The natural sciences exhibition, inaugurated on the 15th of May 1972, presents the physical and geographical conditions of the Iron Gates Gorge, (Hall 1), the flora and fauna of the Iron Gates Gorge (Hall 2), the Danubian ichtyofauna of the Iron Gates storage basin (aquarium), and the water fauna in the Iron Gates region. The exhibition closes with aspects relating to cosmogony, paleontological evidence, testimonies regarding the origin and evolution of man.

Matei Corvin continued the works after 1458, focusing upon the embellishment the existing construction, as the influence of Renaissance bore fruit. The last construction stage took place between 1618 and 1624 when Prince Gabriel Bethlen of Transylvania conducted the last great constructions (the new tower of the gate and the Baroque palace on the east side - currently with a neo-Gothic façade). In 1724, the castle became the property of the Austrian treasury and stayed that way until 1880. That new role, after 1724, brought considerable damage to the monument, including two fires, and the last one in 1854 turned it into a ruin. It was later deserted until 1868, when a restoration began that lasted until 1914. It underwent a new restoration stage between 1956 and 1968. After 1997 began the project of putting to good use the monument that is unique in the east part of Europe and representative for the mediaeval civil and military architecture. The museum established in 1974 at first comprised lapidarium pieces (from the restoration works conducted on the monument by the end of the 19th century and early 20th century).  Currently the museum holds archaeological collections - pottery, lithic, metal and bone pieces, from the systematic excavation conducted in the area of Hunedoara, dating from the Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages; ethnography collections - pieces and accessories of forest workers, tools specific of the area; decorative art collections - pieces of sculpted furniture, guild chests, ceramic and metal plates, wood and glass icons, canvases, wooden statues; coins from the 16th - 19th centuries; military technique artefacts - weapons fro cutting, pushing, hitting, fire arms, most of them replicas).","director":"Sorin Tincu","e-mail":["maiehunedoara@yahoo.com"],"fax":["0254.711.423"],"județul":"Hunedoara","latitudine":"45,749141","localitatea":"HUNEDOARA","longitudine":"22,888279","profilul principal (engleză)":"History","programul (engleză)":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:30 (summer)","9:00 - 14:30 (winter)","Monday: 9:00 - 14:30"],"telefon":["0254.711.423"]},{"URL":["http://www.mcdr.ro/"],"access (engleză)":"In the Park at the base of the Citadel Hill.","adresa":"B-dul 1 Decembrie nr. 39","anul înființării":"1882","categoria (engleză)":"County museum","codul LMI al clădirii":"HD-II-m-A-03225","codul SIRUTA al localității":"86696","codul entității muzeale":"6942500","codul poștal":"330005","coordonatele":"muzeu","denumirea (engleză)":"Museum of Dacian and Roman Civilisation","descrierea (engleză)":"Archaeology: Roman relieves from Ulpia Traiana and Micia, mining tools, medical instruments, bronze pieces, ceramics; ethnography; natural sciences; library (40,000 vols.).","descrierea clădirii (engleză)":"Bethlen Castle or \"Magna Curia\" that houses the museum of Deva is the oldest historic monument building of Deva that has been preserved.

In 1993, the building \"Ambianta\" was offered for use, which was a furniture store and warehouse. With a limited budget, the building was renovated and the spaces were adapted to function as a museum, including an outdoor space to hold patrimonial objects, in time for the museum’s official opening to the public (March 25, 1996). In the year 2000, with the blessing of the P.S. Damaschin Coravu, the Bishop of Slobozia and Calarasi, the Wooden Church from the village of Poiana was placed in the park in the front of the museum. The church is an historical and architectural monument (c. XVIII), unifying the museum collections with the outdoor surroundings. The church was moved on December 17, 2000, keeping the original name \"St. Ierarh Nicolaie,\" to which was added the title \"Buna Vestire.\" It is reintroduced into the cult, after approximately 50 years, now providing all the religious services for the \"Buna Vestire\" Parish.

The core of the museum was established as early as in 1955, upon the initiative of a lively group of Iași teachers and engineers, including academician Cristofor Simionescu, engineer Marcel Itcovici and Professor Ioan Curievici, who was deeply involved in the activity of the Museum, as he searched and found new sources of enriching the heritage, increasing the collections of great scientific and documentary value.

Over the years, following the scientific investigation conducted by a team of specialists from the Museum, as well as the endeavours of finding and purchasing the heritage, we opened new museum departments, such as: “Telecommunications” (1984), “Poni-Cernătescu” Memorial Museum (1991), “Mineralogy-Crystallography” (1997) and “Computers” (2004). The “Telecommunications” department presents to the visitors a series of original exhibits illustrating the historical evolution of the remote data transmission systems and has four theme sectors: telegraphy, telephony, radio, television.

It is the first museum of this kind founded in the Principalities.  In 1840 they bought for the museum the house of the high official Costachi Sturza, on Hagioaiei Street, today 16 Independence Avenue. The museum and the Society have conducted their activity in that building ever since. The building, known also as Roset House, was built by the end of the 18th century in the neoclassical style, and it is currently one of the few architectonic monuments of Jassy that includes in its structure a vaulted ground floor. The museum preserves in its collections pieces donated by early 19th century by Metropolitan Veniamin Costachi (a mammoth bones and hairy rhinoceros collection that used to hang as counterweight at the well sweep in Râșca, Fălticeni district), Prince Mihail Sturza (the Indian elephant Gaba, purchased for the sum of 135 ducats), Iacob Cihac, agha Alecu Balș, Gheorghe Asachi a.s.o. The Natural History Room became known to the general public also due to the fact that in one of its halls, the National Party deputies, on the night of the 3rd/15th of January 1859, elected colonel Alexandru Ioan Cuza as candidate to the reign of Moldavia. The exhibits include historical objects and pieces of furniture, the portraits of those who lay the foundation of the museum and of the Society, of the personalities who conducted their activity in the museum over the years: Iacob Cihac, Grigore Cobălcescu, Anastasie Fătu, Petru Poni, etc. Currently the museum collections count over 300,000 items. The most valuable include: Insects, Mollusks, Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds, Minerals and Plants. In 1840, when the museum moved to the current building, the museum heritage consisted in: 1,500 minerals, 2,844 plants, 3,000 mollusks and insects, 735 vertebrates, and 92 skeletons. The oldest piece in the museum collection is the Indian elephant, that was purchased in 1835 by Prince Grigore Mihail Sturza and brought to the palace, and later donated to the museum. In 2000 the museum inventory counted over 350,000 artefacts, including 3,500 heritage items (5,290 on display and the others stored). The Mollusk Collection comprises almost all the Lamellibranchiate and Gastropoda in Romanian fauna. The Arachnida (spider) Collection is one of the largest in this country; it comprises specimens from Dobrudja, Moldavia and Bukovina. The largest insect collections are Orthoptera, Odonates, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Neuroptera. The Coleoptera include over 50,000 specimens and the best represented families are: Staphylinidae, Meloidae, Cerambicidae and Scarabeidae. The vertebrates collection includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, counting over 14,000 specimens, comprising almost all the species existing in this country and thus making up one of the richest collections in our museums.

Vlasiu’s triple vocation, known especially as a painter, but being a painter and writer to the same extent, did not lead him to an eclectism of endowments. His paintings sought to find the way into the human soul. He has a nostalgia for the village as cradle of the collective national soul he belongs to and whose survival he strives to ensure in the middle of the contemporary human drama. Following the tradition, he seeks strong colourful brilliance, the vegetative intermingled with a rhythmic decoration bringing about elementary images, stylized appearances and primitive vibrations. The world of the village, the landscape, and history are the main domains he chooses his themes from, under the form of the metaphor, the symbol. The ages of man and the road of his life, the depiction of the paragon figures in everyday anonymous world of the village or in history or national culture are prevailing topics. In his sculptures he seeks to attain those original forms of yore that bring about simple bodies, generated by the forces of nature. No matter what his choice of the material might be - stone, wood, gypsum - he tries to reinvent the pure form. While constantly communicating with his native universe, he gives life to this complex world by laconically engendering children’s heads, old people, peasants, intellectuals or heroes. Due to its morphology and style, his sculptures - especially the totemic depictions as well as the works inspired from fairy tales and legends - are directly linked to the traditions of this people. His novels in which the story of his own life reaches the dimension of literary fiction without losing the thrill of the authenticity of the events he experienced, define his human and artistic self whose primary sources in the village is unquestionable in all its hypostases. In his memoirs, sculptures and paintings, Ion Vlasiu lives the permanent revelation of the world outside and inside himself with an authentic dramatic feeling.","director":"Soós Zoltan","județul":"Mureș","latitudine":"46,542719","localitatea":"TÂRGU MUREȘ","longitudine":"24,565277","profilul principal (engleză)":"Art","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 16:00","Saturday: 9:00 - 14:00","Sunday: 9:00 - 13:00"],"telefon":["0265.267.179"]},{"adresa":"Str.

Museology emerged at Târgu-Mureș by the end of the 19th century, when the Cultural and Economic Association of the Szeckler people was established. The first exhibition of the Museum of Industrial Art opened on the 27th of June 1886, and between 1890 and 1893 the building of the Szeckler Museum of Industrial Art was built (the current building of the Museum of Natural Sciences on 24 Horea Street). Having a great historic and documentary value, the collection of the Museum of Industrial Art was almost entirely lost during World War II. Only a small number of exhibits was included in the collection of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography, reopened in the Culture Palace, in 1949. Instead, the valuable pottery and faience collection was saved, and its pieces are today valuable property of the collection of the Transylvania History Museum in Cluj-Napoca. The foundations of a true museum were laid by Aurel Filimon, founder of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography in Târgu-Mureș, an encyclopedic personality, complex as an archaeologist and ethnographer, author of discoveries of great scientific value, that enrich the archaeological and ethnographic collections of the present museum. The permanent archaeological and ethnographic exhibition, organized in four halls on the second floor of the Culture Palace, opened in April 1934. Although the exhibition was closed down under the circumstances surrounding the 1940 – 1944 period, as the collections were stored, the museum continued its activity after the war, until 1957, when, due to a decision of the Regional Party Committee and the Regional City Hall, the building of the former museum of industrial art on 24 Horea Street was made available to the present museum, as there they opened the first exhibition of the Regional Museum in Târgu-Mureș. In 1964 the building listed as a historic monument in 11 Trandafirilor Square was taken over by the museum. There the Department of Modern and Contemporary History of the present County Museum was organized. In 1984 the permanent exhibition of ethnography and folk art reopened, located in 11 Trandafirilor Square, and in 1988 that of natural sciences, in the building in 24 Horea Street. Therefore, by the end of the 8th decade of the 20th century, the Mureș County Museum had become a true museum complex, as four departments and a conservation -restoration laboratory functioned. An important moment in the life of the Mureș County Museum was the 1979 – 1980 period, when the two exhibitions, the archaeology one and the modern and contemporary history one merged and were brought into the Culture Palace. That date can be considered the birth certificate of the Museum of Archaeology and History, found in the structure of the Mureș County Museum. The exhibition room extended on three floors of the left wing of the Culture Palace, as the exhibition comprises themes on the history of the county and the ethnic groups living there, from ancient times to the present day. Currently, that department has changed its premises. The History Museum has a heritage counting about 57,000 pieces, including collections of: decorative art, documents, history, medals and plaques, decorations, coins, science and technology. The exhibition activity was conducted due to temporary exhibitions that valorized the museum collections regarding the development of the city of Târgu-Mureș. The new History Museum exhibition will bear the title of Museum of Mureș Culture and Civilization. The exhibits and the adequate intuitive material will aim at representing all the ethnic groups living together in Mureș land: Romanians, Hungarians, Germans, Jews, etc, since the Middle Ages to the contemporary period.

Brebu mediaeval architectural complex comprising the precinct wall, the Bell Tower, Church and Princely House, represents one of the most important historic monuments from the 17th century in the Prahova county. The precinct wall is built of bricks and river stones, conferring to the precincts an irregular polygonal line. The entranceway is under the bell tower, a massive brick construction, with four storeys and a height of about 30 meters. The church, begun on the 27th of June 1650 (7158 from the genesis), during the reign of Matei Basarab and completed by Constantine Brancovan, according to the legend on the nave and pronaos, has a club-shaped plan, and three turrets. The architecture is inspired by Dealu Monastery Church (16th century), the exterior decoration achieved by Wallachian and Moldavian craftsmen, identical with the Bell Tower. The Princely House has a rectangular plan and thick walls, and the lodging place comprises eight rooms, a terrace provided with a loggia and a pavilion. On the premises of the Princely House, the Museum of History and Archaeology of Prahova county organized a history and feudal art exhibition. The exhibits illustrate the development of agriculture, the crafts and trade during the 17th – 18th centuries, as well as the economic development of Wallachia at that time. Two of the exhibition halls are dedicated to the development of culture, the art of printing that flourished during the time of Princes Matei Basarab and Constantine Brancovan. The exhibits include a few rare Romanian books: “Book of Laws from Govora” from 1640 and “Straightening the Law”, printed at Târgoviște in 1652, considered to be outstanding books for the achievement of a local legal system; the Bible of Bucharest” from 1688 – a monument of Romanian literary language or books achieved by Metropolitan Dosoftei and Antim Ivireanul at Snagov. The collection also includes exquisite pieces of fine and decorative arts: old icons, clothing, boyar’s costumes made of velvet with golden and silver threads, ornaments and period jewelry.","director":"Marinela Peneș","e-mail":["histmuseumph@yahoo.com"],"istoric (engleză)":"Constantin Brâncoveanu, who continued the works begun by Matei Basarab, sent the peasants away from the Podul Cheii border in order to extend the monastery premises, which brought him a lot of criticism. The struggle between monks and peasanys lasted until 1863, when the monastery fortunes were secularized and when the monastery was turned into an unction church, and the estates were taken over by the civil Hospitals. Later, it functioned as a sanatorium, and between 1950 and 1957 it housed an asylum for old people. This architectonic complex was restored two times: in 1843, during the reign of Gheorghe Bibescu, and between 1957 and 1959, under the patronage of the Historic Monuments Department, when the monument was brought to the original shape, and became a museum.","județul":"Prahova","latitudine":"45,18154","localitatea":"BREBU","longitudine":"25,767281","profilul principal (engleză)":"Art","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"],"telefon":["0244.357.731"],"unitatea administrativă":"BREBU"},{"adresa":"Str.

The last restoration, of considerable size, took place between 1990 and 1995. On that occasion, while strictly observing the architectural personality of the monument, the building benefited from the consolidation and refurbishment required by the new outlook of the permanent Exhibition. The idea governing the theme reorganization of the permanent exhibition of the Prahova County Museum of History and Archaeology, was that of singling it out in the context of the relevant local institutions, by valorizing its own heritage, the studies and researches conducted by specialists in various fields (archaeology, mediaeval, modern and contemporary history, numismatics, medals, etc.).

Originally meant to be a dwelling place, Altemberger-Pempflinger House (in the shape of a dwelling-tower), was purchased by the City Hall in 1549. From that year onwards until 1923 here functioned the City Hall, and the city Archives pertaining to the German community until 1948. The monument restoration works were conducted under the authority of the Historic Monuments Division between 1967 and 1988, with intermittences. The restoration was intended to emphasize the elements specific of Gothic architecture, as did also the rebuilding of the upper floor of the dwelling tower, as well as the refurbishment of the space with a view to turning it into a history museum. A marble plaque is embedded in front of the access gate to the building, reading in Latin the visit paid to the City Hall by Emperor Joseph II in the summer of 1773. The building with access to the ground and upper floors is adjoined by a tower that belonged to the third defence precinct of the city. In the garden-courtyard there is an elegant loggia made up of two bays. The museum collections emerged by the end of the 18th century, and many of the pieces were owned by the founder of the museum, Baron Samuel von Brukenthal. His collections pertaining to the History Museum heritage include coins, Dacian and Roman antiquities, as well as many pieces of high worth, from the mediaeval and modern ages, including: mechanisms pertaining to various disciplines of science and technology, musical instruments, decorative art objects (gold and silver ornaments), porcelain, glassware, textiles, weapons and guild’s products. After World War II, as some Sibiu cultural institutions closed or were dismantled, the museum heritage grew considerably due to the transfer to the museum of some collections existing in the city (the Carpathian Society, the Weaponry Room of Sibiu, a part of the pieces from the Astra Association Museum), etc. In 1959 at Brukenthal Palace opened the History Department, in a too narrow a space for the worth and diversity of the collections. In 1986, when the restoration works were completed, two exhibitions opened, and in May 1988 the entire museum circuit was presented, according to the compulsory themes of history museums. Between 1990 and 1992, the themes were completely and fundamentally restructured, as the historical peculiarities of the region were outlined. The permanent exhibition circuit and the storerooms include items illustrating the following fields: ancient history, mediaeval history, both with a lapidarium, modern history, as well as decorative art objects, textiles Period costumes), products of various Sibiu guilds, weapons and armours, iron artefacts, glassware, coins, banknotes, Romanian and foreign medals and decorations, etc. The permanent exhibition circuit comprises the following collections: prehistorical archaeology and ancient history - 8,177 pieces, mediaeval objects collection - 9,669 pieces (mediaeval archaeology - 647 pieces, guild’s products - 1,690 pieces, textile products - 1,500 pieces, science and technology items - 90 pieces, weapons and armours - 1,880 pieces, honour decorations and medals - 239 pieces, glassware and faience - 979 pieces, seals, stamps, dies, medals and coins - 2,374 pieces), the Hoard collection - 63,435 pieces, Carl Engber collection books and periodicals - 15,410 items, the Emil Fischer negative collection - 8,050 items, the documentary graphics collection - 33,252 items, the modern and contemporary history collection, a.s.o.","director":"Sabin Adrian Luca","fax":["0269.211.545"],"județul":"Sibiu","latitudine":"45,796975","localitatea":"SIBIU","longitudine":"24,14959","profilul principal (engleză)":"Roman Archaeology, History, Numismatics","programul (engleză)":["10:00-18:00","Monday, Tuesday: close"],"telefon":["0269.218.143"]},{"access (engleză)":"inside the Cultural House","adresa":"Str.

They asked for credits, public contributions and subscriptions, and in 1894 the building was ready. It is a construction bearing neo-Renaissance elements, designed by the Mediaș architect Franz Maetz. Although small-sized, it gives an impression of monumentality. It stands on three storeys (semi-basement, ground floor and upper floor and originally had 16 rooms. The building never housed any other institution but the museum. There never was any original collection, but a heterogeneous gathering of natural history items that lay the foundation for the subsequent great theme collections. Currently, the most important heritage divisions are the following: mineralogy, petrography, palaeontology, botany, zoology, documentary material (pictures, photographs, slides, documentary graphics). The entire project of the permanent exhibition inaugurated in December 2007 is meant to take into a good account the extent patrimony from a scientific, chronological and esthetical perspective. As elements of novelty in the fashion of presentation, there are the tri-dimensional displaying through the means of dioramas and the sounding and illumination systems suggesting a night and day cycle in each described environment, all conferring to the exhibition a dynamic atmosphere, inducing the visitor an empathic approach to the condition of an explorer.  In the first part of the exhibition is presented a succinct evolution of the live world, from the simplest organisms to the birds, starting with the invertebrates populating the aquatic environment, in seas and oceans, as jellyfishes, worms, corals, shellfishes and continuing with insects, fishes and reptiles, some of them having a frightening appearance, some of them impressing through their shapes and colours.  The presentation of the birds is introduced by the ratite species (the ostrich, nandu and emu), considered to be curiosities of nature. A special part is the one presenting the aquatic birds in a context that reproduces the Danube Delta environment, comprising features of fauna and vegetation as well. The vegetation aspect is illustrated through authentic wood elements as conserved tree trunks. Apart from this expositional space, a slide shore is showed, populated as it is with the species of birds that are characteristic for this particular environment. The middle sector of the exhibition shows aspects in the life of the birds, especially the ones living in trees, from the small species to the large, diurnal or nocturnal birds of prey.  The temperate zone is illustrated through all landforms (from the plane to the alpine heights), each of them populated by their specific fauna and flora. It is the sector where a complete image of birds, mammals and invertebrates is to be seen. Among them there are carnivore animals as the wolf and fox, the bear being along them as well.  The tropical forest is illustrated by the numerous parrots and exotic butterflies, which impress the viewer through their richness of colours and shapes. The features of the most exotic areas on Earth are shown through the abundance of floristic elements, the climatic conditions being favourable for the development of luxuriant vegetation.  The artic zone presents a seal, an animal which is representative for this particular area; it is an item of a historical importance as well, being one of the oldest pieces in the Museum’s collections. There is also a Snowy Owl (Nyctea scandiaca), considered to be the largest and the strongest among the owl species.  The last diorama of this sector illustrates the diversity of the Australian continent. As a consequence of its geographical isolation from the rest of the continents, Australian fauna contains an impressive variety of endemic animals, a large part of the amphibians presented in exhibition populating only the Australian continent. Among the exhibited species there are the Koala, Sugar Glider, Squirrel Glider, Lyrebird, other Australian birds and several species of insects, all meant to impress the viewer.  The palaeontological items in the permanent exhibition are a good opportunity for a reconstitution attempt. It could seem odd today that the animals adapted for a cold climate, as the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros, had dwelled on hills around Sibiu. Their bonny remains are in the possession of the Museum through the effort of one of the founders of the Transylvanian Society for Natural Sciences.  Flanking the flight of stairs, the Mineralogical Sector is arranged in accordance with aesthetic criteria, displaying native minerals as gold, copper, decorative stones, semi-precious stones, rough minerals and minerals discovered for the first time in Romania as tellurate, krenerite, rhodochrosite.","director":"Sabin Adrian Luca","fax":["0269.211.545"],"istoric (engleză)":"***","județul":"Sibiu","latitudine":"45,795019","localitatea":"SIBIU","longitudine":"24,154969","profilul principal (engleză)":"Natural Sciences - Botanics, Zoology; Geology","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 17:00 (summer)","10:00 - 16:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"],"telefon":["0369.101.782"]},{"URL":["http://www.muzeulastra.ro/"],"access (engleză)":"from Calea Rășinari, two entrances","adresa":"Str.

In 1990 the Folk Art and Folk Technology Museum departments emerged into an independent museum unit: “ASTRA” Traditional Folk Civilization Museum stretching over a surface of 96 ha and having two permanent exhibitions: the open air ethnographic museum and the modern wooden sculpture Exhibition. “Franz Binder” World Ethnographic Museum was inaugurated in 1993 and is the first unique museum of extra-European ethnography in Romania. “Cornel Irimie” Memorial Room has preserved memories relating to Cornel Irimie’s outstanding personality, who – from 1953 to his death – organized and led the ethnography and folk art department, and later became manager of the museum. “Emil Sigerus” Museum of Saxon Ethnography and Folk Art, since it was established in 1997, has assumed a complex programme for rescuing, conserving and valorizing the movable and immovable heritage of the traditional culture and civilization of the Transylvanian Saxons. The Museum of Gypsy Culture and Civilization aims at rescuing and conserving the cultural property of the cultural heritage of the Gypsy community (it is the only museum of this kind in Romania).","director":"Ștefan Ciprian Anghel","e-mail":["office@muzeulastra.ro"],"fax":["0269.202.411"],"istoric (engleză)":"ASTRA Museum was founded in 1905 by the Transylvanian Association for the Literature and Culture of the Romanian People.

The most recent open air museum of Romania emerged during the eighth decade of the last century, when the Bukovina village had numerous monuments of folk architecture, but unfortunately, the activity - consisting in transferring several monuments and reconstructing three of them - was interrupted. After 1990, new homesteads and technical installations were moved on the plateau of the city, as 30 monuments folk architecture were reconstructed and put on display. Designed as a traditional Bukovina village, the open air exhibition will comprise 80 monuments of folk architecture: a church, a school, homesteads, workshops, technical installations, a public house. Monuments of folk architecture from the whole Bukovina are reconstructed on six hectares. Vama Church, monument of architecture, dates from 1783. The building is richly adorned with zoomorphic motifs (horse head) and geometric ones (rosette). The church is a classical triconch plan, and the original painting is extant only in the area of the altar. The bell tower was reconstructed next to the church.  Dorna Cândreni House, built by late 18th century, at the time encountered rather frequently, is nowadays a unique piece from the area. The house is fitted with objects specific of Dorna area and an inventory including artefacts used by men for forestry and rafting.  Roșu House, built by late 19th century, is representative for the Dorna area. The large building belonged to well off villagers, which is obvious from the two kilns with town like elements and the wide pavilion at the entrance. The public house of Moș Iordache dates from 1928 - 1930, and functioned as a public house in the village of Șaru Dornei until after World War II.

The exhibits include icons, silverware, ritual books, manuscripts etc. The most precious icons are: a Saint John the Baptist from the 17th century and glass paintings from the 19th century. Other remarkable objects include the silver shrine from 1775 and the cross worked in filigree from 1771. The religious books include the New Testament (1648), the Great Code of Laws (1652), the Bible of Nürnberg (1781). Among the manuscripts we mention the Letter of Arad People to Lugoj People (1848). The emblem of a Timiș bishop (1800) and the Lugoj Guildsmen\u0027s Chest (1819) are other items of interest.","director":"Cristian Cerbu","e-mail":["protopopiatlugoj@yahoo.com"],"fax":["0256.351.971"],"județul":"Timiș","latitudine":"45,687144","localitatea":"LUGOJ","longitudine":"21,905849","profilul principal (engleză)":"Religious Art","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 13:00","Sunday: closed"],"telefon":["0256.351.971","0256.353.632"]},{"access (engleză)":"First Floor of the Serbian Orthodox Bishopric Office","adresa":"Piața Unirii nr. 4","anul înființării":"1967","categoria (engleză)":"Museum belonging to a religious community","codul SIRUTA al localității":"155252","codul entității muzeale":"6500010004","codul poștal":"300085","coordonatele":"muzeu","denumirea (engleză)":"Serbian Orthodox Bishopric Museum Collection","descrierea (engleză)":"Collection of cult objects.","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The museum collection is housed in the Bishopric Palace, built between 1745 and 1748, during the time of Gheorghe Popovici, bishop of Timișoara, on the place of the earlier palace.

After Dobrudja reunited with Romania, it became the headquarters of the Tulcea County Prefecture in 1878. On the ground floor there were the County Court of Justice, the quarters of the bailiffs and the Jury Court. Between 1950 and 1970, it functioned as the Tulcea District Council. It became the quarters of the Art Museum on the 23rd of August 1982.  The Tulcea Art Museum takes pride in holding a significant heritage that constantly grew over the last ten years, from 4,365 by the end of the year 1991, to 7,015 works currently, so that it owns seven collections, as follows: the modern and contemporary painting collection, counting 932 works; the modern and contemporary sculpture collection, counting 420 works; icon collection from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, counting 797 works; modern and contemporary graphics collection, counting 4,016 works; engraving plates collection (unique in this country), counting 400 works; the Oriental decorative art collection from the 18th and 20th centuries, counting 311 pieces; the decorative art collection from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, counting 139 pieces.  Following the theme of \"Dobrudja Reflected in Romanian Fine Art\", the museum presents in the galleries of the permanent exhibition works of great national and international value, that could engender the envy of the great museums. They are works of modern and contemporary graphics and painting, including works by artists, such as: Gheorghe Petrașcu, Nicolae Tonitza, Theodor Pallady, Ștefan Popescu, Petre Iorgulescu Yor, Jean Al.

Bălăcescu, Dimitrie Gheață, Michaela Eleutheriade, and Paul Miracovici. That school of the Black Sea, of the Danube and of the Dobrudjan sunlight, although outstanding, is a natural part of Romanian art, as it was preceded by works of the great masters from the end of the 19th century and early 20th century: Theodor Aman, Nicolae Grigorescu, Ion Andreescu, Ștefan Luchian, George Demetrescu Mirea, Sava Henția, Nicolae Vermont, a.s.o. The museum owns remarkable sculptures by the representative artists of Romanian art: Ioan Georgescu, Dimitrie Paciurea, Frederic Storck, Ion Jalea, Oscar Han, Milița Pătrașcu, Alexandru Călinescu, Constantin Baraschi, Ion Irimescu, Ioana Kassargian, a.s.o. The most valuable works of this collection is undoubtedly that from the vanguard collection represented here by: Hans Mattis Teutsch, Max Hermann Maxy, Marcel Iancu, Corneliu Michăilescu, culminating with the 14 works (ten paintings, four graphics) signed by the well known artist famous all over the world, Victor Brauner.

The most significant achievement is the 1975 emergence of the History and Archaeology Department in the \"Independence Monument\" Park, inside an initial pavilion, later extended due to the construction of the second edifice. Other important achievements involve the emergence of the Art Museum (1972) and the Ethnography and Folk Art Museum (1989). The endeavours of the Tulcea Museum institution towards diversifying the forms of valorisation of the entire cultural heritage in the end led to a changed organizational structure of the Old Danube Delta Museum and its turning into an Institute for Eco-Museum Researches. Tulcea Museum was reorganized by the decisions nos. 118, 119/the 19th of March 1993, as the Institute would conduct its activity in the fields: ecology, ethnography, art history, history and archaeology. Currently, each museum of the Institute conducts its own activity trying to rigorously mingle the scientific activity of cultural heritage research, conservation, restoration, valorisation and enriching with actions pointing to synergic domains. The new strategy of the institution considers that its cultural product has to develop in an integration context involving education, tourism, regional development, international cooperation, aiming at creating diverse effects by multidisciplinary actions.

It shelters ethnography and folk art collections from northern Dobrudja. The ethnography collection comprises a movable heritage presenting the practice of traditional trades and crafts, the lifestyle by the end of the 19th century and early 20th century up to 1950. It includes agricultural and animal breeding artefacts; artefacts for the practice of various trades and for daily life; icons. The folk art collection includes common and decorative fabrics representative for all the ethic groups; costumes and ornaments. The ethnographical collection includes about 1,600 artefacts representing the tools used at practising the traditional trades and crafts. In the field of the processing of animal and vegetable produce for nourishment, the collection presents tools, devices, instruments, weapons, artefacts for fishing, bee-keeping, tree growing, vinegrowing, seed processing, agriculture, flour-milling, animal breeding, and hunting. The ethnographic heritage comprises a remarkable metal vessel collection (267 pieces). The collection is diverse due to the metal used (copper, iron, silver, and lead) and owing to the manufacturing and decoration technique (cutting, boring, hammering, rolling, polishing, incision, filing, riveting, bending, and casting). The museum holds a carpet collection (155 pieces) of a special documentary and artistic value. The woollen carpets were manufactured at the weaving loom and they beautified the traditional interior. The collection comprises carpets of various sizes, from narrow ones to long ones set on the wall or covering one of the pieces of traditional furniture to large ones rectangular in shape usually covering a wall (rug or carpet). The collection includes remarkable carpets with complex compositions made up of bunches of flowers, birds, town life scenes, depicted in a naturalist manner and arranged as medallions. The colours ranged from discrete ones (green, ochre, and dark blue) to strong ones (yellow, orange and red). Black (a background colour) and white (used to emphasize motifs) balance the colour composition. The presence of the Aromanians in Dobrudja is revealed by their contribution to the preservation of the traditions reflected in the heritage owned by the museum: 670 pieces (household and decorative fabrics, costumes). The thick woollen or goat\u0027s-hair fabrics of various colours used to prevail in the Aroman traditional house. The traditional male and female Aromanian costumes are made up of numerous diverse pieces (peasant woollen skirts, shirts, long coats a.s.o.). The one hundred ornaments were executed by ancient techniques (filigree, \"au repoussé\" hammering, engraving, and intarsia).","director":"Sorin Ailincăi","e-mail":["etno@icemtl.ro","relatiipublice@icemtl.ro"],"fax":["0240.513.231"],"județul":"Tulcea","latitudine":"45,179523","localitatea":"TULCEA","longitudine":"28,805883","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["8:00 - 16:00 (summer)","10:00 - 18:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"],"telefon":["0240.516.204"]},{"URL":["http://www.icemtl.ro/"],"adresa":"str.

Currently, the museum is representative due to its four sectors: 1.The Homestead Sector - the dwelling comprises 42 units and over 12,000 museum artefacts, illustrating the homestead structure, according to the traditional trades: agriculture, fruit-growing, vinegrowing, animal breeding or a series of folk crafts and techniques; the diversity and planimetric and volumetric evolution of the dwellings with one or more rooms are emphasized. The remarkable exhibits include the houses with pavilion in the Horezu ethnographic area (in the communes of Măldărești, Stoenești, Bărbătești), the homesteads specializing in winegrowing, moved from Drăgășani (the villages of Prundeni, Olteanca), in fruit growing (the communes of Alunu, Tomșani, Cernișoara) or in animal breeding in the mountainous regions (the villages of Boișoara, Pâscoaia-Brezoi). Next to the dwellings, several adjoining constructions were moved to the homesteads: barns, sheds, haylofts, coops for food storage or for breeding birds and animals.  2. The Social - Cultural Sector of the \"public utility monuments\" includes a rural primary school from the beginning of the 20th century, from Spiru Haret\u0027s time; an inn from the end of the 19th century from the village of Săliște, the commune of Mălaia; a wooden church, built in 1785 and moved from the commune of Nicolae Bălcescu; a swing from the commune of Stoenești, and in the future this sector will be completed with other architectonic sites.  3. The Folk Crafts - Techniques Sector presents the procedures and techniques for processing the raw matter necessary for manufacturing tools, vessels and various household items, the methods used for vegetal or animal fibre processing or the traditional techniques for obtaining animal and vegetal products. Several workshops were moved and reconstructed inside the museum: the pottery from the location of Vlădești (the 20th century); the joinery-carpentry workshop (the 20th century) from the village of Șerbănești, the commune of Sălătrucel; goat\u0027s hair processing workshop (early 20th century) from the village of Curtea, the commune of Popești; as well as a smithy from the commune of Prundeni. It is worth mentioning also the installations - the mills driven by hand and the watermills from the ethnographic area of Loviștea, plum-brandy boilers from the localities of Stoenești and Buda, the fulling mill from the locality of Costești, the drying kiln for plums from the village of Muiereasca de Sus, or several winegrowing installations (presses), organized inside the homesteads of some winegrowers, moved from the localities of Mitrofani, Olteanca, Prundeni, in the area of the Drăgășani vineyard.  4. The Specialized Constructions Sector - represented by a few items illustrating those in the village border or in the mountainous zone: roadside cross, moved from the localities of Govora-sat and Feteni, border wells, beehives, a sheepfold moved from Smeurat Mountain, a vine manor moved from the commune of Fârtatesti, watch towers, etc. Last but not least, the valuable Vâlcea folk art is displayed in the museum by the interior decoration of the dwellings, inside the workshops, as fabrics or pottery, wooden and metal artefacts, icons and pieces of furniture.","director":"Claudiu Aurel Tulugea","județul":"Vâlcea","latitudine":"45,141537","localitatea":"BUJORENI","longitudine":"24,363589","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["10:00 - 18:00 (summer)","10:00 - 17:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"],"telefon":["0250.746.869"],"unitatea administrativă":"BUJORENI"},{"URL":["http://www.arhiram.ro/manastiri/manastirea-govora"],"access (engleză)":"Râmnicu.Vâlcea - Târgu Jiu (km 15) national road","anul înființării":"1968","categoria (engleză)":"Museum belonging to a religious community","codul SIRUTA al localității":"171361","codul entității muzeale":"51520002701","codul poștal":"247379","coordonatele":"muzeu","denumirea (engleză)":"Govora Monastery Museum Collection","descrierea (engleză)":"Mediaeval art; history of printing.","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"A historic monument, a princely building from 1492 belonging to Radu the Great, that prevented St. Govora Monastery from falling into pieces, by building up stone churches, defence walls and cells.

It had no narthex, instead it used to have pilasters fastened at the south ends of the lateral valves, in order to sustain some transversal archways, and compartmentalized the interior space of the lateral naves, on both sides of the entrance to the central nave, a wide entrance situated on the apse axis. In the central zone of the apse, under the altar pavement, there is a monumental martyr crypt, completely buried, housing a group of four martyrs at the upper part of the martyrion - Zotikos, Attalos, Camasis and Philippos, and two martyrs on the lower level, that originate in an earlier martyr tomb. The martyrion at Niculițel is a unique monument in Europe. The protecting edifice creates an elegant, aired and pleasant interior. The perimetral gallery destined to the inflow of visitors ensures a permanent visual contact with the monument, and the permanent exhibition of paleo-Christian artefacts, colour photographs and slides complete the museum collection. The discovery of the monument is due to torrential rain in the spring of 1971 that uncovered a part of the crypt cupola.

In 1944, Ellie Wiesel together with the whole family and the other Jews from Sighet and Maramureș, counting over 38,000, were deported by the Horthys and the Nazis in death camps. The young adolescent would be marked for life by the unimaginable crimes and horrors that occurred in the Auschwitz, Birkenau and Buchenwald camps. The known novelist, playwright, essayist and memoirist Ellie Wiesel has always pleaded for peace. Currently, Ellie Wiesel, a winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace, is a titular of the Humanities chair of Boston University, while 55 universities worldwide awarded him the title of \"Doctor Honoris Causa\", including Yale University. Between 1980 and 1986 he was the president of the Holocaust Memorial Council in the USA, while currently he is a member of many councils. It is worth mentioning that in 1986 his name was engraved on the \"Statue of Liberty\", next to the names of other 11 immigrants to the USA, on the occasion of the 100 year anniversary from its inauguration in New York on the 29th of July 2002. His first book of memoirs, \"La Nuit\", issued in 1958, accounts his experiences in German concentration camps. From that year onwards, he signed almost 40 books, all of them inspired by the ordeal of the Jews during World War II. His works reveal his profound empathy with the condition of the Jews and of other ethnic groups, who suffered persecutions and humiliations because of their religion, race or national origin.","director":"Gheorghe Todinca","e-mail":["muzeulmaramuresului@yahoo.com"],"județul":"Maramureș","latitudine":"47,92987","localitatea":"SIGHETU MARMAȚIEI","longitudine":"23,894339","profilul principal (engleză)":"Memorials","programul (engleză)":["8:00 - 16:00 (winter), 10:00 - 18:00 (summer)","Monday: closed"]},{"URL":["http://muzeulmaramuresului.ro/"],"codul SIRUTA al localității":"108954","codul entității muzeale":"51620000133","codul poștal":"437305","coordonatele":"muzeu","denumirea (engleză)":"\"Stan Ion Pătraș\" Memorial House","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The house of folk craftman Stan Pătraș, the author of the painted funerary crosses form the famous \"Merry Cemetery\" form Săpânța.","director":"Gheorghe Todinca","județul":"Maramureș","latitudine":"47,973735","localitatea":"SĂPÂNȚA","longitudine":"23,698205","profilul principal (engleză)":"Memorials, Ethnography","unitatea administrativă":"SĂPÂNȚA"},{"anul înființării":"1955","codul SIRUTA al localității":"109844","codul entității muzeale":"51620000135","codul poștal":"227446","coordonatele":"muzeu","denumirea (engleză)":"\"Tudor Vladimirescu\" Fortified Manor House (Cula)","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The village of Cerneți, lying in the Topolnița Plain, 5 km north-east from Turnu Severin, relates to a large share of Tudor Vladimirescu\u0027s activity.

The permanent exhibition is organized chronologically, trying to outline the multicultural and multi-ethnical character of the university life in Cluj throughout the centuries. Our Museum hosts data and information about the evolution of the academic institutions of Cluj, starting with 1581 when a Jesuit College - presided by the well-known monk Antonio Possevino - was founded in the city. A special attention is given to the history of the university, which is today known under the name of Babeș-Bolyai. With the help of old photographs, original documents or facsimiles, personal belongings of the professors, books written or used by them for the study of sciences or humanities, the history and activity of each college, faculty and university which existed in Cluj throughout the centuries, is reconstructed for our visitors.  Our first exhibition displays present data about the students and professors who studied and worked at the colleges created by different religious orders - catholic or protestant - between the 16th and 19th centuries.

Starting from this collection, a small museum was opened under the protection of the Museum of Sighetu Marmației which did not survive the harsh communist period of 1985-1989. The building becomes a relict and it was eventually given and most of the exhibits were lost. After the revolution the local community succeeded in re-opening the museum in 2001 and the building was renovated. The next step was completing the collections, restoring the old objects and buying or receiving new ones as donations. On the 1st December 2003 the Museum of History and Ethnography of Vișeu de Sus was opened for the public.  The present building of the Museum belonged to a German family. It turned into a museum in 2003 by adding a new storey to it. On the ground floor there is a 40 sq.m. room dedicated to the History Department, offices and an exhibition room of 30 sq.m., as well as a storage room for the objects of the Museum. On the first floor there is a 70 sq.m. room dedicated to the Ethnography Department, a 20 sq.m. room for cult objects, a 20 sq.m. restoration laboratory, a 10 sq.m. office and a toilet, as well as a 30 sq.m. terrace for bigger objects on display. The History Department is hosted by one room where objects and pictures (reproductions of documents and photographs) are displayed in five show cases and nine glass panels presenting the local history. The exhibition includes: archaeological pieces (flint tools, axes and bronze bracelets, ceramic fragments from the Iron Age and Mediaeval Age); a quote from the Royal Diploma of King Ludovic I of Hungary from the 2nd of February 1365 attesting the existence of Cuhea domain and the two \"Vișaie\"; Roman, Polish, Austrian and Romanian coins; documents proving the existence of a German element in Vișeu - a fragment from the baptism register of Roman Catholic Church, where are attested the first births of German children (1790), a German travelling chest; documents of noble families from Vișeu and other villages; documents of the Great Union from the 1st December 1918 and pictures with local delegates that took part in the Assembly from Alba Iulia; images from the town and Vaser Valley in the period between the two World Wars; local personalities, cultural and religious life; images of ethnics from the town (pictures taken in the Orsk prison camp in the Ural mountains where 86 Germans from Vișeu were deported between 1945-1949).

It dates from the last ten-year period of the 19th century, when there were some private tries of organizing this kind of museum. The General Department of Telegraph and Postal Services tried hard to establish a Postal Museum, but this was only achieved around 1891. The new museum was presented to the public at the general Exhibition of 1906, when the well-known architect Grigore Cerchez, general manager of the Post at the time, rebuilt an old postal inn on the Exhibition precincts and presented there various items of postal history and the stamps of the General Department of Telegraph and Postal Services. However, the museum was short-life. In 1958, on the occasion of Romanian Postal Mark centenary, the Minister Council emitted a decision of founding a philately museum, decision that unfortunately was not materialized.

It dates from the last ten-year period of the 19th century, when there were some private tries of organizing this kind of museum. During the inter-war period, the Romanian Post has made the steps in order to found a museum, but those weren’t enough.   The General Department of Telegraph and Postal Services tried hard to establish a Postal Museum, but this was only achieved around 1891; the new museum was presented to the public at the general Exhibition of 1906, when the well-known architect Grigore Cerchez, general manager of the Post at the time, rebuilt an old postal inn on the Exhibition precincts and presented there various items of postal history and the stamps of the General Department of Telegraph and Postal Services. However, the museum was short-lived.   In 1958, on the occasion of Romanian Postal Mark centenary, the Minister Council emitted a decision of founding a philately museum, decision that unfortunately was not materialized.  According to the G.D.287/03.04.2004, it was decided to give the title of museum of national importance to the National Philately Museum.   The year 2004 marks the rebirth of this museum, by the will, determination, decision and efforts of the friends of philately and of the Post.

The open air collection is located in the inner courtyard, in the space in front of the Geology - Paleontology Chair.  The Paleontological and Stratigraphical Museum of \"Babeș-Bolyai\" University has a long history and a rich scientific tradition. It emerged as an academic collection in 1919, by partially taking over the collections of Francis Joseph University (inaugurated in 1872.). The collections were later reorganized and enriched with samples donated by geology professors and students. The exchanges conducted with museums and collectors in this country and abroad also contribute to the continuous diversification of the museum heritage. The museum currently has a number of about 50,000 samples, grouped in the following collections: The taxonomic paleontology collection gathers a systematic arrangement of fossil plants, invertebrates and vertebrates in this country and abroad.  The most valuable collection is the specimen one and includes over 200 species of fossil plants and animals, representing new species for science and described for the first time in Romania. The general stratigraphy collection comprises fossils and rocks from Europe, ordered chronologically, from the Cambrian to the Pleistocene. The Transylvanian Basin collection is a regional collection, unique in Romania. It comprises mollusks, echinus, fossil vertebrates and plants from the Palaeogene and Neogene of the Transylvanian Basin. The important regional collections include those in the west basins (Șimleu, Borod, Zarand) or the rock collections (Simplon tunnel - Switzerland, Apuseni Mountains, Transylvanian Depresion).

Thus, the public keen on authentic spiritual values has the opportunity to contemplate an artistic universe evoking inner energies. An experience lived beyond conventions would strongly influence the personality of master Nagy Imre. His reclusion in the privacy of his native village of Jigodin, in the Harghita area, refusing the temptations of urban life, would bring about the experience of a specific way of existence where the picturesque of the place intermingles with social realities. Everything would originally reflect in his vast creation. A perfect master of various techniques (water colours, tempera, oil), Nagy Imre would grasp and immortalize the richness of light and colour in the area of Ciucului depression. An admirable sense of space is revealed in the elements of nature in harmonies animated by lyrical vibrations or in rhythmic cadences oriented towards the vigour of monumentality. More often than not, in the privacy of the natural setting, forever fresh and vital, he brings in human beings comfortably flooded by the ripple of water, the breeze of the wind, the reflections of the vegetation, the calls of cosmic immensity. Nothing grand, nothing cryptic, still everything so profound, close to our soul. Driven by a strong pantheist feeling, he cultivates trust in the positive meaning of life, defining for a creator loving beauty, truth and essence. The portrait definitions of the self - making up a cycle - reveal due to the firmness and the drawing and tension of the colours, the unbinding character, the vigor of the inner nature and the clear-mindedness.","director":"Soós Zoltan","județul":"Mureș","latitudine":"46,543459","localitatea":"TÂRGU MUREȘ","longitudine":"24,563047","profilul principal (engleză)":"Art","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"],"telefon":["0265.265.267"]},{"URL":["http://www.zootirgumures.ro"],"adresa":"Str.

When the gates opened there were only ten animals, currently there are about 500 animals belonging to 120 species, both local and exotic fauna. Currently the garden is divided into five sectors: primates, herbivores, carnivores, the tropical Pavilion, the Lake. The primates’ Pavilion shelters the ten species of monkeys, representing the African primates: baboons with mantle (Papio hamadryas), baboons (Papio cynocephalus), cercophytecus, such as the savannah monkey Cercopythecus aethiops), the hussar monkey (Erytrocebus patas), as well as the magot (Macaca sylvanus). Asia is represented by various species of macaques, such as the common macaque (Macaca fascicularis), the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina)) and the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). At the moment South America is represented by only one species, namely apella (Cebus apella). In the hall there are tropical plants: banana tree, Washingtonia palmer, Phoenix, ficus, and small-sized exotic plants. The herbivore section is on the highest side of the garden and was built by enclosing a natural space. The night shelter of the animals renders the local folk architecture. In the Zoological Garden the carnivores include bears, prey birds and various small mammals belonging to this category of animals. The felines are sheltered in the lions’ Pavilion. Next to the lions’ pavilion, there are the cages for pumas, lynxes and wild cats. There we find the lions, leopards and jaguars. The facilities of the bears, that has functioned since 1986, shelters bears and wolves. This sector includes also prey birds. The tropical pavilion was established in 1983 and is divided into three subsections: the aquarium section, the parrots’ cages and the reptile section. The aquariums are 37 in number and present various fish of the exotic fauna. The amphibians and reptiles sum up about 11,000 species. In the reptile section the order of the crocodiles is represented by the cayman (Caiman crocodiles), that lives in Central and South America. Next to the crocodile pool there is a row of terrariums for constrictor snakes: rhe yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus), the tiger python (python molurus) and boa (Boa constrictor). There is also a collection of smaller snakes: the water snake (Natrix natrix), the cave rat snake (Elaphe taeniura), the common rat snake (Elaphe obsolete), and the common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula). There is another representative of the reptiles: the green iguana (Iguana iguana). In the central part of the building there are the cages of the exotic birds, represented mostly by parrots. We can come across the monk parakeet (Myopsittas monachus), the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), the rosella (Platycercus eximus), the red-rumped parrot (Psephotus haematonotus), and the budgie (Melopsittacus undulates).  Opposite the cages of the birds there is a botanic garden with various exotic plants. The lake, artificially built over the years, has become a real biotop.

In 1974 the continuously growing collection was placed into a peasant house built at the beginning of the 20th century. In the next decade the collection was extended with objects from different ethnographic regions of Transylvania and Moldavia. The first exhibition was organized in 1993 with the title: \"Traditional Folk Art of Zăbala\". The first the permanent exhibion called \"The Traditional Folk Art of the Moldavian Csángós\" was opened on September 14. 2003, within a festive event. the professional inventory, administration and description of the collection was carried out step by step by the ethnography students of Babeș-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca. In 2004 Pro Museum Association was founded, the owner of the collections and the immovables. From 2005 the Museum is an external Department of the Sekler National Museum of Sfântu Gheorghe, Covasna County. In 2007 we started the accreditation process of the Museum and its inclusion into the national museal circuit of Romania. The exhibitions can be visited since 2003. The Csángó Ethnographical Museum – as a Department of the Sekler National Museum – received a preliminary notification of functioning in December 2007 from the Ministry of Culture, Cults and National Patrimony. The institution is supported by the Local Council of Zăbala, by Covasna County Council as well as by different cultural foundations. The most valuable part of this collection is represented by ceramic tiles. Among the 200 pieces we can find some from the 15th–19th century, manufactured under the influence of Rennaisance, Rococo and Classicism. The scientific research on the tiles found at Zăbala and deposited in the Museum produced several papers published in specific volumes. From the 200 pieces we managed to take stock and describe different bowls, jugs and other ceramics collected from the village and its surroundings. A part of these are the works of local craftsmen from the 18th–19th centuries, but we also have products from Corund, Mădăraș, Bârsănești, Satul Nou, Iara, Vadul Crișului, Rădăuți, Vama, Turda and Zalău. The Saxon collection of our museum was realized at the end of the 20th century, and it was exhibited in Tg. Mureș, Cluj-Napoca, Sf. Gheorghe, Sighișoara and Zăbala. It includes first of all traditional festive costumes, interior textiles, different pieces of furniture and ceramics, coming from the regions of Sibiu, Sighișoara, Țara Bârsei. With the help of these items we are able to represent the change within the Transylvanian Saxon culture and lifestyle during the 19th and 20th century. In addition to the collection of objects there is a rich photo and documentary material available. This collection of furniture represents the culture of peasant interiors from the 18th–19th–20th centuries. The most valuable items of this collection were manufactured in the 18th century. The most valuable dowry chests were painted in the 19th century. The collection hosts several pieces of furniture from the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, showing a strong influence of Secession. The interiors from the first part of the 20th century are the best documented ones, the collection containing complete pieces of furniture from several peasant houses. This collection consists of textiles related to family life, to interiors, to everyday and economic life. In the last few years we managed to collect several complete dowries from the interwar period. The Sekler costumes collected in the settlement expose a changing process from the beginning of the 20th century to our present days. Thus we can trace the evolution of the modernizing region\u0027s popular costume. The ethnographic collection of Zăbala contains numerous articles of personal and everyday use: containers, water jugs, salt cellars, hand mills, grain mortars, wood skates, hammer, grain shovel, umbrella, fire tong etc. The historic collection consists of objects related to the historic memory of the locals, different historic representations kept in private interiors. There are also objects related to WWI and WWII. We also have numerous objects, representations on the members of family Count Mikes, who had an important role in the social, economic, confessional, social and educational life of the village. The Romanian Collection of Zăbala presents first of all local interiors, different pieces of furniture, interior textiles, popular costumes from the beginning of the 20th century. We have documented the life style of a Romanian family from Zăbala through interviews, documentaries, photographs starting with 1974. This way we inherited the interiors of this family consisting of furniture, textiles, articles of personal use and festive costumes. As the major occupation of the local Romanians used to be sheperding, the present collection presents different objects related to animal keeping and milk processing in the Vrancea Mountains. The Romanian collection also contains interior textiles and traditional local costumes. We can enumerate popular costumes for men and women from the first part of the 20th century, shirts, cloaks, mantles etc. The interior textiles are represented by kerchiefs, pillowcases, bedspreads, carpets, curtains etc.Along with pieces of furniture, articles of everyday use, costumes and textiles, the Romanian collection includes objects of a memorial character: photographs, diplomas, icons etc. This collection also includes costumes, textiles, ceramics from other Romanian regions: Oaș, Făgăraș, Bistrița, Crișuri region, Banat, Sibiu, Vrancea, Bucovina. Csángó Collection was brought together by the founder of the Museum and by the results of the fieldwork carried out since 1991 by the researchers of Kriza János Ethnographical Society and the staff of the Department of Hungarian Ethnography and Anthropology of Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca. The collection presents mainly 20th century Csángó textiles, traditional interiors from Lespezi, Oituz Bacău, Pustiana, as well as the shop of potter Gabor Raymund. There are also everyday and festive costumes, furniture, musical instruments, objects and printings related to their religious life and articles of personal use, pottery from Oituz and Frumoasa. Most of the objects represent the essential moments in the sacred and the profane life of the Moldavian Csángós, from birth to death: for example there are objects related to customs, everyday life, religious life, costumes related to the rites of passage, the art of sewing, sacred objects (books, rosaries etc.), musical instruments, symbols of christening, wedding and funeral. The collection is documented with the help of an outstanding visual material. In the villages of Covasna County Gypsies are dealing with different traditional craftsmanship: burning of bricks, manufacturing of baskets and brooms, while in other settlements they are making bins of wood for grains or flower. We would like this crafstmanship diversity to be presented within our Museum especially by the products of the craftsmen from this region: tiles, brooms, baskets as well as the tools in use for the manufacturing of these.","e-mail":["csangomuzeum@gmail.com","petibotond@gmail.com"],"județul":"Covasna","latitudine":"45,892118","localitatea":"ZĂBALA","longitudine":"26,183064","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["10:00 - 18:00"],"telefon":["0267.375.566"],"unitatea administrativă":"ZĂBALA"},{"URL":["http://www.muzeulgorjului.ro/index.php?option\u003dcom_content\u0026task\u003dview\u0026id\u003d48\u0026Itemid\u003d42"],"codul SIRUTA al localității":"78105","codul entității muzeale":"6938509","codul poștal":"217530","coordonatele":"muzeu","denumirea (engleză)":"Cartianu House Ethnographic Collection","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The building, which occupies a picturesque position on the bank of the Cărtiorul stream, was built at the end of the 18th century.

Their relics and works are exhibited in the Bolyai Memorial Museum founded in 1937, in a room of the Protestant College Library. In 1955, the museum and the college library, home to 20,000 pages of manuscripts by the two Bolyais, were moved to the building of the Teleki Library.  At the beginning, the Bolyai Memorial Museum belonged to the Protestant College Library (i.e. the Bolyai Library), which later merged with the Teleki Library and is today the Teleki-Bolyai Library. The museum has always been managed by the librarians. Bolyai Farkas (1775-1856) was born in the village of Bólya, Szeben County on 9 February, 1775. The family belonged to the nobility, but by the time Farkas was born they were no longer wealthy. He started his schools at the Nagyenyed Protestant College. He was considered a prodigy due to his talent in mathematics and languages. Later he transferred to the Kolozsvár Protestant College. He developed a passion for mathematics at the University of Göttingen. This is where he became a life-long friend of the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. When he returned home, he settled in Kolozsvár. He performed his inaugural address at the Marosvásárhely Protestant College on 4 May, 1804. For the next 47 years, he was professor of mathematics, physics, chemistry and astronomy at the college that today bears his name.  His life work is of an extraordinary diversity; however, he was most outstanding as a mathematician. His first works treat the parallel axiom. His masterpiece, the Tentamen (Marosvásárhely, 1832) contains his reflections on the foundations of mathematics, a number of innovative thoughts ahead of his time. He originally intended his books on mathematics as textbooks. He was an outstanding theoretical pedagogue; he wrote several works calling for changes in public education. Some of the points he argued for were a more cleverly organized curriculum and practical education.  Bolyai János (1802-1860) was one of the greatest personalities in the history of mathematics. He broke new grounds in science: the creation of Non-Euclidian geometry revolutionized geometry and the theory of physics and replaced Newtonian theories about the world.  He was born in Kolozsvár, on 15 December, 1802. He was brought up in Marosvásárhely and attended the Protestant College. He showed a great interest in mathematics as a child. However, due to the limited financial possibilities of the family he couldn’t attend the University of Göttingen; instead, he went to the Military Academy of Vienna. The military career was a burden to him. He entered the army engineering corps and was sent to Temesvár, Arad and then to Olmütz; then, at the age of 30, he retired and moved home to Marosvásárhely. He lived a retiring life here and on his estate in Domáld, which the family had inherited from Farkas Bolyai’s mother. From a young age, János Bolyai was interested by the unsolved problems of mathematics, most of all the 9th axiom of Euclid, the Postulate of the Parallels. With hard work, he developed Non-Euclidian Geometry as early as in 1823. He wrote down his findings in his work entitled Scientia Spatii, which was only published in 1832, as an appendix to his father’s book Tentamen. One of the greatest achievements of the age, it still didn’t bring any change in Bolyai’s life. His name remained unknown for the world of science.","județul":"Mureș","latitudine":"46,542719","localitatea":"TÂRGU MUREȘ","longitudine":"24,565277","profilul principal (engleză)":"Memorials","programul (engleză)":["9:00 - 17:00"],"telefon":["0265.261.857"]},{"URL":["http://www.cjarges.ro/obj.asp?id\u003d13320","http://www.satul-gales.ro/muzeul","http://www.satul-gales.ro/muzeul"],"access (engleză)":"At 24km NE of Curtea de Argeș and 55km N from Pitești.","adresa":"nr. 172","anul înființării":"1976","categoria (engleză)":"Local Museum/Collection","codul SIRUTA al localității":"14806","codul entității muzeale":"7105101","codul poștal":"117149","coordonatele":"localitate","denumirea (engleză)":"Ethnography Museum","descrierea clădirii (engleză)":"Local style house specially erected for museum.","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The Ethnographic Museum was organized in a local style building (19th – early 20th century), at the initiative of the former teacher Florea State, in with six rooms at the first floor.

Although the space existing in the school is not enough to exhibit all the objects and only those that are valuable from historical point of view. Thus, they have been exhibited in small selections that make up the permanent exhibition of the school museum. The Archaeological Collection is made up of artifacts from the Stone Age to Modern times, discovered in the sites of the our county, or other sites in the country. The Coin Collection of the school museum is made up of Romanian coins or banknotes alongside with a lot of decorations and medals issued on various anniversaries of national and international historical events. Although the school is located in the middle of the city, we considered it necessary to arrange an Ethnographic room, specific for the Vlașca area, made up of a collection of weavings, wooden furniture, ceramics, folk costumes and household objects. Local history is illustrated by various collections: old books, technical corner, military history, “Teohari Antonescu” museum in Giurgiu, with which we still cooperate. The three-rooms of the museum in the school is used both as an attraction for the visitors and resource for teaching and documentary aide for the History and Romanian literature classes. The museum of School no. 4 ”Mihai Eminescu” was visited by many people keen on history and by personalities from Romania and abroad, their impressions being written in the “Golden Book” of the school museum.","e-mail":["scoala_mihai_eminescu@yahoo.com"],"județul":"Giurgiu","latitudine":"43,893512","localitatea":"GIURGIU","longitudine":"25,969036","profilul principal (engleză)":"History","programul (engleză)":["Monday - Friday: 8:00 - 18: 00","Saturday, Sunday: on demand"],"telefon":["024.621.72.72"]},{"codul SIRUTA al localității":"167990","codul entității muzeale":"515205046","codul poștal":"245700","coordonatele":"muzeu","denumirea (engleză)":"\"St. Elias\" Church Museum Collection","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The museum has collections of historical and religious art.","județul":"Vâlcea","latitudine":"44,661265","localitatea":"DRĂGĂȘANI","longitudine":"24,265238","profilul principal (engleză)":"Religious Art"},{"anul înființării":"1960","codul LMI al clădirii":"VL-II-a-A-09904","codul SIRUTA al localității":"171432","codul entității muzeale":"515208126","codul poștal":"247379","coordonatele":"localitate","denumirea (engleză)":"Church Objects Collection of Scărișoara","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The religious collection is exhibited in two rooms; it gathers approximately 40 cultural objects.

The school functioned “in some old boyar’s houses, made available for this purpose by the Almasanu Bank, to which Cihodaru (the architect) has built, nearby, other headquarters.” (N. Iorga, “A human’s lifetime”). Inside that “new headquarters”, the dining hall and the weddings hall were installed.  The building dates from the XIX century. The necessary funds were gathered due to a call launched in 1921 and to a subscriptions list. The young teachers, chosen from the best in all country’s regions and citizens (Romanians, Saxons and Hungarians) were trained in a new pedagogical, scientific and patriotic spirit for one year. Those missionaries were creating, in the rural areas, a new Romanian soul. Nowadays, the building hosts an exhibition of religious art which continues the idea of another cultural establishment - namely the Religious Art Museum, founded in 1923 by Nicolae Iorga at Valenii de Munte and left under the care of the Missionaries’ School. The exhibition includes, in its four halls, exhibits of outstanding value, beginning with wooden icons from the XVII – XIX centuries, silver and brass candleholders, wooden and metallic hand crucifixes, pectoral crucifixes, priestly garments (miter, felonion, sleeves, epitrachelion, epigonation, cingulum), chalice coverings dating from the XIX Century, gilded silver chalices, waist inkwells, old ecclesiastical books, wool carpets, kandilas. These objects were crafted in local workshops and are bearing Russian, Greek, occidental and oriental style influences. One room is dedicated to the local heritage - objects from the XVIII – XX centuries, such as: wooden icons, ecclesiastical books, chalices, worship pots, a monastery tabernacle. All these are property of the Valeni Monastery church and are kept in custody by the museum.  BARSESTI: The museum is the property of Mr. Costică Beș, an autodidact man owning approx 370 objects. They are held in precarious conditions, in 3 small warehouses and an inner courtyard. In his collection work tools (looms, ploughs, coopers\u0027 tools), household objects, ceremonial objects (flasks and woven fabrics), parts of traditional clothes and musical instruments. There are, also, objects specific to a museum (photos, weapons, decorations/distinctions, documents) reflecting the local history in the period between the two World Wars. AVRAMIDE: The building is renovated; it presents aspects of the urban life of Tulcea town between the end of the XIX and beginning of the XX centuries. Carrying on this project aims at highlighting Tulcea identity within the Dobrogea regional one. Also, the complex is foreseen to have an interactive component, through diverse cultural and artistic activities intending to connect the past to the future. The complex, composed of the Avramide House and the Art Museum (in no.2, Grigore Antipa street), will exhibit: art (paintings and sculpture) with works of consecrated Romanian painters and, also, works by contemporary painters; painting and engraving workshops for children and amateurs; oriental art exhibition; Dobrogea art exhibition; art exhibition of the national minorities; small concerts, associated to important cultural events; cultural events.

Rebuilding and expanding the Church became necessary in 1804 through the establishment of new bishopric of Satu Mare. The present Cathedral built in Neoclassical style was developed during bishop János Ham between the 1830 -1837. Though not documented some experts believe that it is the work of architect József Hild. The Basilica type Church is oriented East to West. It encloses three naves and an elongated semicircular choir towards the East. The external aspect of the Cathedral is determined by the main facade that forges its monumental aspect. The old vestry opens a side entrance from December 1, 1918 str. into the Diocesan Museum.

She has been living in this town all her life. Her father and grandfather were tailors who specialized in Szekely clothes. She was familiar from early childhood with the Szekler folk costumes of Madaras-Ciuc. She also got to know the folk costumes from neighboring villages.  Over the years she noted that the traditional costume from her village is changing, shifting and evening out. Traditional garb was colorful in the past. Women and girls wore different Szekely clothes according to their age. This changed and became standardized. Slowly, the old garments remained in closets or were sold. Interestingly, in the neighboring villages this change was happening at a slower pace. Her objective was to preserve traditional garb, so she started collecting garments from the past, skirts, aprons, photographs of the past and any objects that were costume related. She has sown 37 small folk costumes for dolls. Of these, 6 costumes now reside at the Ethnographic Museum in Keszthely in Hungary. The exhibition includes numerous original or recreated costumes, a collection of postcards and a collection of 800 old photos. The space allotted for the collection is not very big, but it fits the owner\u0027s vision for the exhibition. During her activity she took down information regarding Seckler costumes and our habits, which resulted in four books (2008, Customs and traditions of Mădăraș; 2009, Past and present Seckler costumes, wearing Seckler costumes at various events in the Madaras Ciuc village; 2010, Important families and talented people from Mădăraș).","director":"Tankó-Molnár Mária-Terézia","e-mail":["maria.tanko@freemail.hu"],"județul":"Harghita","latitudine":"46,496097","localitatea":"MĂDĂRAȘ","longitudine":"25,7521","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography, history","programul (engleză)":["10:00-17:00 (prior reservation for groups)"],"telefon":["0747 246 657, 0266 335 705"],"unitatea administrativă":"MĂDĂRAȘ"},{"adresa":"str.

The community’s cultural heritage was organized thematically as follows: local history, ethnography and church history. The largest space is devoted to the ethnographic side of the museum: a rural cottage interior; storytelling customs; the presence of wheat in traditions, customs and the sacred space; traditional viticulture; photography as an ethnographic document.  Both the objects and their placement in the room show how the interior of a cottage- a two room mud brick structure covered with straw - was organized in the nineteenth century: the entrance hall and the house proper(living room) with a back porch. Including everything from traditional furniture to fabrics and folk garb, the display is enriched by the reenactment of the traditional custom of storytelling. Old photographs complete the ethnographic overview of this settlement with moments from the popular calendar, important events from everyday life, along with those showing the evolution of traditional garb over time. An attempt was made throughout the exhibit to provide a unified picture of an ancient occupation, agriculture, with a focus on plants that are at the heart of many stages of human life: wheat and vines. An important part of the display is dedicated to traditional viticulture. The display depicts the process the grapes go through from the vine all the way to the finished product, accentuating the distinctive pieces related to vineyard work such as the stone winepress from the second half of the eighteenth century. The wheat grain also has a special place due to the history and importance of cereal cultivation as well as its inclusion in Romanian folk habits, beliefs and practices regarding the human life cycle, yearly events and the sacred space. Two separate areas are reserved for local history. One space is devoted to some archaeological evidence from one of the most important Dacian fortresses from Alba county, APOULON (PIATRA CRAIVII), highlighting the triple role of the old fortress: military, civic and spiritual center. The other area highlights the religious history of this community drawing the visitor’s attention to fragments of frescoes and eighteenth century iconostases, old books and a religious painted glass icon from the Maierii Bălgrad art center.","e-mail":["office@traditiongroup.ro"],"județul":"Alba","latitudine":"46,162801","localitatea":"BUCERDEA VINOASĂ","longitudine":"23,527994","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["on demand"],"telefon":["0258-844441, 0729-914697"],"unitatea administrativă":"IGHIU"},{"URL":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitie-etnografica-bucium-sasa/"],"access (engleză)":"village centre, in the school building","adresa":"Principală","anul înființării":"2006","codul SIRUTA al localității":"3468","codul entității muzeale":"7101530","codul poștal":"517165","coordonatele":"stradă","denumirea (engleză)":"Ethnographic exhibition","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"Several artists have worked in this village, such as folklorist Ion Pop Reteganul, who printed the Foișoara magazine, and writer Ion Agârbiceanu, who depicted realistically in novels the harsh rural life - especially in the novel “Archangels”. The Bucium ethnographic exhibition brings attention to these local peculiarities. Bucium was an important trade center for furriers (beautifully decorated coats and vests), carpenters and folk costume manufacturers. Given the needs and possibilities of the locals, the manufacture of certain pieces of clothing and footwear became a specialized trade. Male garb consists of: shirt with large front and back gussets, trousers and vest with an old-fashioned cut, simple vest, white coat, protective woolen footwear and shoes. Female garb consists of: shirt and skirt, front and back apron, tricolor belt, two overlapping singlets and jacket. The head is covered with a scarf. In addition to these, rich ornaments made of gold and silver are also customary. Another feature that is worth noting is the type of singlet worn by the Bucium women, one short and very close to the body and one longer and wider, with side godets, worn on top of the first, both decorated with fine embroidery of black cotton and gold thread. The crafts from this area coincide with crafts from other areas, such as textile processing, but here, thanks to the area’s specific, people had other occupations as well, such as furring and goldsmithing.","e-mail":["liliana.duna@yahoo.com"],"județul":"Alba","latitudine":"46,26299","localitatea":"BUCIUM ȘASA","longitudine":"23,174275","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["on demand"],"telefon":["0731- 366449, 0729-161937, 784112, 784160"],"unitatea administrativă":"BUCIUM"},{"URL":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografic%c7%8e-cenade/"],"access (engleză)":"Communal Library, in the village centre","adresa":"str.

In conjunction with it there are some tools and components used in the homemade textile industry: sley, shuttle, shuttle box, picker, reed, warp beam, wool combs, distaffs, spindles, etc. These homemade pieces are simple, without ornamentation. The furniture is also simple, unadorned, but its simplicity is complimented by the beauty of the bedding and tablecloths woven by the village women. These pieces were adorned with fine cloth decorated with great skill by local women with a good eye for color coordination.  Besides towels, glass painted icons, plates, jugs, earthenware, antique irons, mortars and pestles, lamps, we can also mention a chest, a crib, a wedding flag, the steward’s canteen and wooden clubs for announcers, these latter objects pertaining to the traditional wedding custom. A major part of these traditional creations is the folk costume and this is proven by the large amount of clothing pieces on display, some of which were lovingly donated to set up this collection.

A distinct element of this exhibition is the presence of women’s winter costumes specific to this area and these reflect a massive influence of city garb elements seamlessly integrated into the traditional costumes. Important moments of village life and especially the life of local people are captured in old photos. The hallway is the room housing the loom and all the objects necessary for homemade textiles: distaffs, pulleys, reels, shuttles, spindles. Here we find on display fabrics produced through the toil of long winter nights when the storytelling took place. Items made through this craft were used to make clothing, scarves, towels, tablecloths, carpets, rugs, bags. In traditional homes the clothes and other fabrics used in everyday life were hung on a horizontal pole suspended from the ceiling beam. The influence of the Hungarian ethnicity is present throughout the exhibition by means of traditional garb belonging to the two ethnic communities, Romanian and Hungarian.

Among the simple earthenware we find a few fine china objects, such as an “untieai\" (receptacle for holding butter), which presumably belonged to a noble family from the area. The “boacaz” is the annex where we find the clay bread oven and where the flour was sifted, the dough was kneaded and the bread was baked; the patellas lean against the mouth of the oven and next to them we find the sifting sieve, the kneading trough and the flour chest. Next to this we find the tool shed and the barn which attest to the traditional occupations, with displays related to activities such as agriculture (truss, plow), gathering and viticulture (implements for vine picking), wine preparation and storing (muzzle, barrel and gourd).","județul":"Alba","latitudine":"46,249704","localitatea":"CETATEA DE BALTĂ","longitudine":"24,169471","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["on demand"],"telefon":["0258- 886101, 886364"],"unitatea administrativă":"CETATEA DE BALTĂ"},{"URL":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografic%c7%8e-ciuruleasa/"],"access (engleză)":"in the Kindergarden","adresa":"str.

The movable and intangible heritage of the area which was recovered from the villagers was exhibited in a thematically structured ethnographic collection. Arranged in three rooms, the exhibition reconstructs the interior of a cottage as well as specific activities such as weaving and viticulture. As shown in the traditional home decor, a special place is held by the female traditional costume with two skirts, undershirt and petticoats. Made at first from homemade fabric, this type of garb has undergone some changes during its evolution because commercially purchased cloth was increasingly used (jolj, silk, cotton cloth), which in turn changed the decorative style of the costume. The male costume consisted of a long shirt with ornate collar worn over trousers, usually with a broad leather girdle, decorated with different motifs made by stamping. Summer pants were made of white cloth and the winter pants, or trousers, from white or gray rough homespun. For cold weather, both men and women wore sheepskin vests and rough homespun overcoats.  In the living room there were one or two beds, one to the left and one to right, the table between the two windows, and one to three benches, one next to the wall facing the street and the others next to the other walls. The one next to the wall facing the street was fixed and the others movable, so that they could be brought to the table when serving food. Chairs were scarce, only two or three. The benches were replaced with daybeds where clothes were stored. Under the crossbeam there were pegs from which ornamental wares hung. Behind the door was the sideboard which held the potter; glass painted icons and family photos were on display on the walls. Weaving was a more laborious task, requiring several prior operations: setting up the warp, mounting the warp and setting up the weft. Setting up the warp usually took place within a larger space in the courtyard beside a fence. Mounting the warp consisted of putting the warp yarns on the back roll of the loom, held taut with rods between them as not to get tangled. Mounting the weft was a complicated operation and it took place in the house. Depending on the type of fabric and the technique used for it the warp threads and the weft threads were properly placed. If a lot of viticulture tools can be found in an agricultural inventory, such as hoes, spades, picks and even to a lesser extent plows and saws, there are certain objects, such as the vine knife -best known as the sickle -, as well as some wooden vessels for grape picking, wine pressing and storing, which are related specifically to viticulture.","e-mail":["ionelablagu@yahoo.com"],"județul":"Alba","latitudine":"46,174749","localitatea":"CRICĂU","longitudine":"23,571117","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["on demand"],"telefon":["0258- 845105, 0727- 354235"],"unitatea administrativă":"CRICĂU"},{"URL":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografica-cut/"],"access (engleză)":"in the courtyard of the Parish House","adresa":"str .Principală nr. 598","anul înființării":"2007","codul SIRUTA al localității":"4124","codul entității muzeale":"7101590","codul poștal":"517206","coordonatele":"localitate","denumirea (engleză)":"Ethnographic exhibition","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"Set up in the historic building of 18th century Bethlen castle, the ethnographic exhibition stores objects that highlight the main traditional occupations - agriculture, husbandry and viticulture - and crafts - blacksmithing, coopering, carpentry, masonry and weaving. The exhibition depicts a cottage with the entrance in the middle of the hallway, with a room on either side of it. Here we find the hearth and the bread oven. The horn for the oven was wide, crossing the roof, serving as a smokehouse as well. The house walls and the ceilings of the living quarters were made of wooden beams and unshaped stakes.  The traditional folk costume of Cut, through its appearance, lines, decoration and color is representative of the entire area of the Secas valley, resembling the so-called \"Săliște suit.\" The woman\u0027s costume consists of the following parts: undershirt, petticoats (“poale”), vest, ornate skirts, apron and as headgear the “chișchinău” - a headscarf of varying color according to age. Slippers or boots were worn on the feet. The long winter overcoat, reaching over the knee, completed the costume. A white kerchief wrapped around the head, also called a “propoada” , was customary for a woman’s costume. Girls covered their heads with black scarves, with red feathers and green slippers. In winter they wore long woolen knee socks (cioci).  The man\u0027s costume consists of the following main parts: knee-length shirt, made of hemp, flax or cotton; instead of pants, they wore woolen or linen tapered trousers toped with a black leather girdle; lambskin vest worn over the shirt, or overcoat made of black cloth.  In addition to folk garb, women wove carpets on the loom. The needlepoint or woven finery is a thing of beauty. The wool rugs are different from the carpets because they lack the decoration. Tablecloths are woven together with the carpets and they differ only in size since the cloth and the decoration is the same. Pieces of hemp and cotton cloth are woven with two or more threads over a white background. The earthen mugs and large cups are shorter, with a taller neck, fitted with a spout for draining the liquid. Pitchers, also known as cups, alternating between a spherical and oval profile, have a very narrow neck, a small rim and a single round handle which communicates with the bottom through a channel.","e-mail":["avva_cut@yahoo.com"],"județul":"Alba","latitudine":"45,93563","localitatea":"CUT","longitudine":"23,665434","profilul principal (engleză)":"Ethnography","programul (engleză)":["on demand"],"telefon":["0258- 745111, 0745 - 371969"],"unitatea administrativă":"CUT"},{"URL":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografica-daia-romana/"],"adresa":"str.

Made of cotton or hemp, the undershirt was quite wide; the sleeve cuffs (cipca) and puffy shoulders (hammers) were embroidered with black “arnica” (a type of single thread spun cotton). The apron, consisting of two woolen sheets, was woven on the loom; the skirt was also woven but had a single sheet and was hemmed with lace. In autumn or spring the women wore a wide gilded coat over the vest and in winter they switched to a woolen sheepskin coat (cojocuta). The headgear consisted of a white kerchief over which a black headscarf was wrapped.

The hillside plow or moldboard plow with symmetric coulter and oscillating rudder was sturdier to allow it to furrow better. Local craftsmen showed their creative spirit by making houses, furniture, everyday utensils, means of transport, gates, churches, shrines and wooden crosses. Their decoration was done with very simple tools: knife, ax, chisel, hatchet, saw. The material they used was oak, pine, beech, maple, walnut, elm.

Glass painted icons are placed on the walls and loom woven mats are placed on the floor, over the packed earth.

In the hallway we find a variety of rustic weavings, carpets, undershirts, Romanian and Saxon folk costumes, ornamental napkins - meant to create a pleasant environment - woven from various vegetable fibers: flax, hemp, cotton and wool. All these were produced within the household and the exhibition includes items such as: loom, distaff, spindle and shuttle. A corner of the exhibition is reserved for the Golden Age, with a wall displaying photos of members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, led by Nicolae Ceausescu, and this segment includes a collection of newspapers from that era. All these artistic creations mark aspects from the life and history of the region, with an important contribution made by craftsmen who, through their exquisite skill, transformed the line, decoration and chromatics into a perfect artistic blend, using factory and homemade materials.  The old names for the village were Kakova, Olah Szaszs, Vlad Haza or Vladhaza. Documentary attestation came late in 1733, but it is not consistent with the age of this village. The „Adormirea Maicii Domnului” church - an important historical monument for the area - still lies within the village and it was mentioned in Transylvanian statistics as being built in the early seventeenth century. An ethnographic exhibition was opened in two rooms in order to highlight the cultural heritage of the area, trying to provide as much detail regarding aspects of yesteryear traditional life. The interior of the rustic house is fairly plain. The house has a single room where all the activities took place and it has a fixed structure comprising: table, daybed, chest, sideboard, dowry chest, and loom. The daybed was customary in farmhouses and it sat next to the wall in front of the table. It was used as a bench for sitting at the table and in the evening it could be used as a bed. Interior woven fabrics were made of: hemp, hemp and cotton, hemp and wool. The towels, bedding, pillowcases, cloth bags, napkins, saddlebags and mattresses were homemade only. Traditional garb bears the imprint of the mountainfolk and the Lunca Mureșului area, since the town lies at the confluence of these two ethnographic areas. Women\u0027s clothing consisted of: hand sewn undershirt sometimes decorated with motifs specific to the area, petticoats covered by a skirt, vest and sheepskin coat in winter. A kerchief was worn on the head. Men\u0027s clothing consisted of: hemp or wool trousers, shirt, woolen overcoat, leather girdle and sheepskin hat.

The oil lamp hung from the cross beam and was lit in the evening; at night a rushlight was used in case one had to go into the yard. The floors were protected with woven cloth. Wooden vessels were used to make bread and process milk. The dough and bread were made using a pan, a small wooden trough and a wooden shovel. The processing of milk used a pail, a trough, a large spoon, some rope and a wheelbarrow for transportation. The smaller pail was used to transport water and the cutting board held the cornbread which was cut with a long piece of thread attached to the board. The objects used for hemp processing (crusher, combs, reed, carder, reel, spindle) and wool processing (combs, distaffs, etc.) are well represented.

The cloth can have a plain weave (beaten), a twill weave or a sateen weave depending on which technique is used. The most demanding and painstakingly difficult technique is the sateen weave. Through this technique one makes patterns after choosing the types of yarn and the colors of the fiber according to a given pattern.  Another category of textiles is used for clothing: shirts, aprons, skirts, petticoats, undershirts, trousers, keeping with the specific of local costumes - black skirts with different color stitching and shirts with darting. The interior consisted of a hallway and the house proper, the former being used more in the summertime. Here we find the hearth where the oven for baking bread is set and it occupies almost half the room. The smoke went straight up to the attic because the room had no ceiling. Within the house the traditional bed occupies most of the room, both in length and in height, with a long seat set along its side. A long dresser made with the same technique as the seat and a table were also placed in this room.

I. Cuza” - IAȘI","descrierea sumară (engleză)":"The institution, as a department of the University, aims to exploit its dual heritage, given by the academic vocation and archaeological research. The ”Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University Museum functioned since 1985 within the Rector’s Office. Thanks to Octav Davideanu, former chief-secretary of the University, many objects valuable for the academic life were preserved, though not all of them became available for the public.  A significant part of documentary patrimony and objects remained in several personal archives, while a series of exhibits and documents were fragmented and given in the custody of some institutions, such as Petru Poni Museum, The Museum of the Union, State Archives etc. Some of them have been recovered in recent years through donations and purchases, along with getting in custody. The current location of the institution offers the academic collection a generous space, organized both by thematic criteria and in relation to various historical stages of the higher education in Iasi. Thus, a Rector’s Office is presented, with proper furniture, the first academic medals, various seals and some of the university symbols, namely the silver hammer and trowel used on May, 23rd 1893 at the solemnity of settling the fundamental stone of the University Palace in Copou. A substantial area is allotted to the historical evolution of the institution, as its official opening and the anniversaries of 1910/1911, 1960, 1985 and 2010 are reminded of by representative exhibits (the flags of the first universities, pictures of important figures, official documents, medals, photos, publications). Most part of the academic collection presents the evolution of disciplines, aiming to illustrate the achievements in knowledge and scientific carrier of important figures. Various laboratories, the Museum of Natural History, the Botanical Garden and the University Central Library are properly presented, thus revealing the importance in the research plan of each of these components of academic space. A special attention is paid to former students of the university, who are depicted in terms of activities developed both in formal space and out of it. International relations of the oldest Romanian university are outlined in a separate frame. In addition to furniture, meant to create an academic feeling, the atmosphere is audio-visually backed up by Romanian and English films about the history of the institution. The Cucuteni Civilization Museum: In 1916, through the efforts of Orest Tafrali, the first entity for preserving the antiques belonging to the heritage of the “Alexandru Ion Cuza” University of Iasi from archeological excavations at Cucuteni culture was founded. After World War Second these objects entered the custody of the History Museum of Moldavia, an institution subordinated to the Ministry of Culture.  During the postwar period, the research undertaken by archeologists from the Faculty of History and the Institute of Archeology of Iasi, namely Radu Vulpe, Mircea Petrescu-Dîmbovița, Marin Dinu, Attila László, Dan Monah, Nicolae Ursulescu and Vasile Cotiugă led to the founding of a new collection, representative for material life and spiritual manifestations that made this ancient civilization known. Some of the most valuable pieces, revealed by several archaeological diggings, and exhibits from the Collection of Cucuteni for the 3rd Millennium Foundation are now brought together in the “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University Museum. The area dedicated to Cucuteni civilization is organized in a modern manner, so that images depicting scenes of daily life are illustrated by original exhibits. The central room introduces guests to the fascinating domain of archaeological research through a major reconstruction, which shows various stages of exploration, from archaeological diggings to restoration of pieces revealed. The entire space presenting the Cucuteni civilization emphasizes creations belonging to ancient people, which are organized in the exhibition area according to their specificity. Thus, the visitors first enter the art room, with famous spiral motif vessels, painted in red, black and white, then the trades room, with various tools and weapons and a dwelling specific to the epoch, and end the tour in the treasure room, with priceless exhibits, such us ornaments and objects of worship.  This latter area bears a special feeling, due to the winding form of clay walls and the ceiling playing for the starry sky under which the inhabitants of this part of Europe formed a civilization 7000 years ago. A great audio-video material rounds out the original manner of organizing this area, by presenting the results of archaeological research, particularly the experimental ones, so that the entire assembly depicts, in an authentic manner, a fragment of the past.","director":"Bogdan-Petru Maleon","e-mail":["muzeul@uaic.ro"],"județul":"Iași","latitudine":"47,176132","localitatea":"IAȘI","longitudine":"27,568277","profilul principal (engleză)":"History","programul (engleză)":["Tuesday- Friday: 8:00 - 16:00","Saturday, Sunday: 10:00 - 15:00","Monday: closed"],"telefon":["0232.20.11.02, 0232/20.24.51"]},{"URL":["http://recomespar.ro/achim.html"],"access (engleză)":"15 km from Sibiu, DJ 106 B or railway line Sibiu – Copșa Mică","adresa":"str.
