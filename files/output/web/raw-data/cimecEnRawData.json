The house was probably built by the cupbearer Costache Jianu, Iancu\u0027s father, at the end of the 18th century, being a construction with a ground floor, first floor and a cellar. The ground floor has a floor below ground level of about 20 centimeters and consists of three modestly sized rooms, probably a kitchen and food storage spaces, the main entrance having massive oak doors with iron hinges handmade by blacksmiths of the time. Upstairs are three living rooms and an enclosed glass porch that faces north, as does the main entrance to the house. The cellar is provided with battlements in the south wall and small windows, probably used in case of a siege. The monumental ensemble includes the house, the outbuildings of the house and the hut.

The house itself and the valuable pieces it contains in the inventory (inkwell and brush, flint pistols, shotgun, chimera, water, personal items, pieces of furniture and household items, photographs and documents of the Jianu family), convincingly illustrates the way of life and social unrest of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.","County":"Olt","General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"OT-II-m-B-20149","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Caracal","Main profile":"Memorials, Historical Personalities","Museum code":"51620000192","Name":"\"Iancu Jianu\" Memorial House","Part of":"Museum of Romanați","Phone":["0249.511.344"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000192_01.jpg"],"Postal code":"235200","Time table":["Closed for restoration"]},{"Address":"Strada Mănăstirii Clocociov nr. 3","Administrative subordination":"Slatina and Romanați Diocese","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1632\u0026-Muzeul-Manastirii-Clocociov-Slatina-Olt","Collection(s)":"The monastery complex was built by Diicu Buicescu, high official during Matei Basarab\u0027s reign.

The donation from the primary school teachers Ecaterina and Paul Pașa constituted the core of the planned exhibition. On the 24th of January 1939 the museum opened. During the period 1950 - 1956 the collections of the Museum of Art and those of the Museum of Natural Sciences were brought in this building. The museum was closed to the public in 1986 in order to restore the building and reorganize it. Since 1995 it has been known as the \"Prince Cuza House\" Museum, and on the 20th of May 2004, in a wing of the house opened the permanent coins, medals and stamps exhibition. The first three halls on the ground floor display the specificity of fashionable Galați salons, with furniture representing the main styles of the period (for instance: the library given as a gift by Charles I to Mihail Kogălniceanu). The fourth hall is dedicated to scientific and technical progress from the same period (for instance: a \"De Dion-Bouton\" company automobile, French model, built in 1898, equipped with an internal combustion engine). The exhibits of the upper floor hall are relevant for the activity and personality of Prince Cuza, his family and collaborators (for instance: decorative art items, clothes and accessories, etc).","Contact person":"Costel Ilie","County":"Galați","Director":"Cristian-Dragoș Căldăraru","E-mail address":["muzeuistorie@yahoo.com"],"Fax":["0336-819.852"],"General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"GL-II-m-B-03007","Importance":"County","Locality":"Galați","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"51620000190","Name":"\"Prince Cuza House\" Museum","Part of":"\"Paul Păltănea\" History Museum","Phone":["0236.412.408"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000190_16.jpg"],"Position":"Șef secție","Postal code":"800216","Time table":["Temporary closed for restoration"],"Website":["http://www.migl.ro/cladiri/cuza%20ambele.html"]},{"Access":"Underground line 2, University Station","Address":"Calea Victoriei nr. 12, sector 3","Administrative subordination":"National","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1624\u0026-Muzeul-National-de-Istorie-a-Romaniei-Muzeul-National-Filatelic-Bucuresti","Collection(s)":"Ideea organizării unui muzeu filatelic în România datează încă din ultimul deceniu al secolului al XIX-lea, când au fost încercări notabile pe plan privat. Timp îndelungat Direcția Generală a Telegrafelor și Poștelor a făcut demersuri pentru înființarea unui muzeu poștal, dar abia in jurul anul 1891 înființează unul, când renumitul arh. Grigore Cerchez, directorul general al Poștelor, construiește, în incinta parcului expozițional, un vechi han de poștă în care au fost expuse piese de istorie poștală și timbrele ale acestei Direcț;ii. Existența acestuia a fost însă de scurtă durată. În 1958 a existat o tentativă - din pacate, eșuată - de înființare a unui muzeu filatelic. În 2004 se acordă titulatura de muzeu de importanță națională Muzeului Național Filatelic. Acesta are sediul în imobilul aflat în administrarea Muzeului Național de Istorie a României. Clădirea concepută în stil neoclasic este realizată după planurile arh. Al. Săvulescu. Poșta centrală a orașului a funcționat aici până în anul 1970, când au început lucrările de renovare a clădirii și de amenajare a Muzeului Național de Istorie a României. Muzeul Național Filatelic permite vizitatorilor - în cele trei săli de expunere - să admire o parte din tezaurul Poștei Române. Sala George I. Lahovary este consacrată în întregime mărcii poștale românești. Într-un sistem modern de expunere se pot admira vestitele Cap de Bour emisiunea I - a, valorile de 27 și 54 de parale, urmate de frumoase piese din emisiunile Principatele Unite și Cuza. Deosebit de interesante sunt colile din emisiunile clasice litografiate (Carol I cu favoriți și barbă), din care unele sunt unicate pe plan mondial. Alte piese deosebite sunt colile duble de 300 de bucăți ale emisiunii Paris, cu diverse însemnări și adnotări ale tipografilor francezi. Se continuă prezentarea emisiunilor românesti pînă în anul 1962 și pentru perioada 1990 - 2002. Se poate aprecia că majoritatea timbrelor românesti expuse sunt piese unice deoarece sunt prezentate (până în 1956) sub formă de coli nedantelate. În general, acolo unde a fost posibil, au fost prezentate la aceeași emisiune, atât machetele (probele de artist), cât și eseurile (probele de tipar) și colile nedantelate care au stat la baza tipăririi ulterioare a seriei respective. Probele de artist (machetele) sunt opere de artă în sine, realizări grafice de excepție, deseori semnate de mari artiști. Matrițele (clișeele) originale cu care au fost imprimate diverse emisiuni se găsesc expuse în vitrinele sălii Lahovary. Se pot admira celebrele matrițe ale emisiunii I - a Cap de Bour (inclusiv valoarea neemisă), plăci litografice (piese absolut inedite) și diverse alte clișee de mărci gravate sau tipografiate, clișee de cadru sau de cifra valorii. Foarte interesante sunt și matrițele de realizare a filigranului (sitele de filigran). Sala Cezar Librecht, dedicată istoriei Poștei Române, cuprinde piese originale, replici și machete, toate ilustrând aspecte ale evoluției poștei timp de peste 100 de ani. Sunt expuse costume de surugii, goarne și efecte poștale, trăsuri de poștă, lăzi de valori, diverse tipărituri și altele. Evoluția filateliei este prezentată în sala Dimitrie C. Butculescu, aici se organizează diverse expoziții filatelice temporare. În cadrul expoziției permanente sunt expuse medaliile obținute de Poșta Româna la expoziții filatelice naționale sau internaționale, precum și diverse publicații și tipărituri filatelice (exemplu: revistei \"Filatelia\"). Deține bunuri culturale clasate în Tezaurul patrimoniului cultural național.","Contact person":"Iolanda Tabără; Răsvan Popescu","County":"București","Director":"Dr. Ernest Oberländer-Târnoveanu","Fax":["021.312.55.85"],"General profile":"History","Importance":"National","Locality":"București","Main profile":"History","Museum code":"51620000188","Name":"National Philatelic Museum","Phone":["021.312.55.86","021.312.55.42"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000188_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000188_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000188_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/51620000188_04.jpg"],"Position":"Șef Serv. muzeal; șef Serv.conservator","Postal code":"030026","Time table":["Closed"],"Virtual tour":["http://www.imagofactory.ro/muzee/mnf/mnf.html"],"Website":["http://www.muzeulfilatelic.ro/"]},{"Address":"DN 1","Administrative subordination":"Company","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1623\u0026-Muzeul-Apei-Floresti-Cluj","Collection(s)":"In 1992, the Cluj County Water - Sewerage inaugurated, on the occasion of the one hundred anniversary of the water and sewerage plants in Cluj, the first and only water museum in Romania, one of the few of this kind worldwide.

Starting from this collection, a small museum was opened under the protection of the Museum of Sighetu Marmației which did not survive the harsh communist period of 1985-1989. The building becomes a relict and it was eventually given and most of the exhibits were lost. After the revolution the local community succeeded in re-opening the museum in 2001 and the building was renovated. The next step was completing the collections, restoring the old objects and buying or receiving new ones as donations. On the 1st December 2003 the Museum of History and Ethnography of Vișeu de Sus was opened for the public. The present building of the Museum belonged to a German family. It turned into a museum in 2003 by adding a new storey to it. On the ground floor there is a 40 sq.m. room dedicated to the History Department, offices and an exhibition room of 30 sq.m., as well as a storage room for the objects of the Museum. On the first floor there is a 70 sq.m. room dedicated to the Ethnography Department, a 20 sq.m. room for cult objects, a 20 sq.m. restoration laboratory, a 10 sq.m. office and a toilet, as well as a 30 sq.m. terrace for bigger objects on display. The History Department is hosted by one room where objects and pictures (reproductions of documents and photographs) are displayed in five show cases and nine glass panels presenting the local history. The exhibition includes: archaeological pieces (flint tools, axes and bronze bracelets, ceramic fragments from the Iron Age and Mediaeval Age); a quote from the Royal Diploma of King Ludovic I of Hungary from the 2nd of February 1365 attesting the existence of Cuhea domain and the two \"Vișaie\"; Roman, Polish, Austrian and Romanian coins; documents proving the existence of a German element in Vișeu - a fragment from the baptism register of Roman Catholic Church, where are attested the first births of German children (1790), a German travelling chest; documents of noble families from Vișeu and other villages; documents of the Great Union from the 1st December 1918 and pictures with local delegates that took part in the Assembly from Alba Iulia; images from the town and Vaser Valley in the period between the two World Wars; local personalities, cultural and religious life; images of ethnics from the town (pictures taken in the Orsk prison camp in the Ural mountains where 86 Germans from Vișeu were deported between 1945-1949). The Ethnography Department hosted in two rooms - In the first room the occupations of the local people are illustrated with old pictures and wooden objects: agriculture, shepherding, work in the woods, processing hemp and wool, popular art and pottery. In a closed show case are presented elements of popular clothing of different peoples that have lived here. Among the exhibits on display we mention: for agriculture: flail, pick to cut the bramble, wooden ploughs, yoke, primitive mill, bee hive, comb for blueberry, etc, for sheep herding: wooden buckets to keep water and milk, ladles, meddles, milk measuring, churning stick, etc, for work in the woods: pictures of raft sailing on Vasser Valley, Viseu, Tisa, and Iza rivers pike axe, etc, for domestic objects and popular art objects on display are made of wood, such as: different size mugs, bowls, pots, spoons, salt keepers, pepper pots, flasks, dowry chest, pictures of old houses, etc, for processing hemp and wool: a very important craft in the area; here we have spinning machine, spindles, etc. In the display of popular clothing there are ten mannequins (man-woman, bride-groom, boy-girl, German men-German woman, Hungarian men-Hungarian woman) wearing popular costumes.

The idea of such a museum was first discussed in 1994 at the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Cluj Romanian University and was again analyzed in 1999 at the 80th anniversary. Initially opened in only two rooms, the History Museum of the \"Babeș-Bolyai\" University was expanded in January 2002 in other three rooms. The permanent exhibition is organized chronologically, trying to outline the multicultural and multi-ethnical character of the university life in Cluj throughout the centuries. Our Museum hosts data and information about the evolution of the academic institutions of Cluj, starting with 1581 when a Jesuit College - presided by the well-known monk Antonio Possevino - was founded in the city. A special attention is given to the history of the university, which is today known under the name of Babeș-Bolyai. With the help of old photographs, original documents or facsimiles, personal belongings of the professors, books written or used by them for the study of sciences or humanities, the history and activity of each college, faculty and university which existed in Cluj throughout the centuries, is reconstructed for our visitors. Our first exhibition displays present data about the students and professors who studied and worked at the colleges created by different religious orders - catholic or protestant - between the 16th and 19th centuries. Significant aspects of the evolution of the Hungarian University \"Franz Josef\", which functioned in Cluj between 1872 and 1918, when Transylvania was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, are next displayed. Most of the permanent exhibition is however dedicated to the development and activity of the Romanian university,\"King Ferdinand’’, which existed in Cluj between 1919 and 1945. Our permanent exhibition also displays information about the creation and evolution of the \"Babeș-Bolyai\" University, which appeared in 1959 by an unification of the Romanian and Hungarian universities, and has, since its appearance, transformed itself into a multicultural, European level university, with many Faculties and specializations and a high level of scientific research.","Contact person":"dr.

The experts of the Archaeology and History Museum in Tulcea which governs the museum have arranged the two rooms on the ground floor. One of them is dedicated to the memory of Jean Bart - a personality that at the beginning of the 20th century was at Sulina a sea commissary. The second one is dedicated to the European Danube Commisions - an international organization that transformed the small fishing settlement from the beginning of the 19th century into an important harbour with a flourishing economy. The exhibits of the Sulina Lighthouse Museum belong to the modern and contemporary history collection of the History and Archaeology Museum that belongs to the Eco-Museum Research Institute. One can remark the pieces of furniture that belonged to the writer Jean Bart and his family photographs, the weaponry collection from the 18th - 20th centuries, the medals, documents, maps and photographs relating to the activity of the European Danube Commission. As the name indicates, the Sulina museum was organized in a lighthouse, that was built by the European Danube Commission between 1869 and 1870. The project was designed by M. Engelhardt, a doctor, a collaborator outside the Technical Office of the European Danube Commisions. The project was managed by Sir Charles A. Hartley. Over the years the construction underwent several changes on the outside and inside, which did not affect the original structure. After 1989 the Sulina Great Lighthouse was restored by the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, and in 2003 was taken over by ICEM Tulcea. The building has historic value and was listed in 2004 with the indicative TL II mA06023. The construction is 17.34 m high, in the shape of a truncated cone, has two large rooms on the ground floor, arranged for the museum, and the exhibition space is 70 sq.m. The rooms built around the Lighthouse, at number 7, that functioned as homes for the staff and deposits for the materials necessary for the operation of the lighthouse, are currently used as museum annexes.

Sighetul Marmației reminds him of childhood memories, but also tragic memories relating to the loss of his family during the deportations from Horty\u0027s period, when many Jews fell victims of these events. In 1944, Ellie Wiesel together with the whole family and the other Jews from Sighet and Maramureș, counting over 38,000, were deported by the Horthys and the Nazis in death camps. The young adolescent would be marked for life by the unimaginable crimes and horrors that occurred in the Auschwitz, Birkenau and Buchenwald camps. The known novelist, playwright, essayist and memoirist Ellie Wiesel has always pleaded for peace. Currently, Ellie Wiesel, a winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace, is a titular of the Humanities chair of Boston University, while 55 universities worldwide awarded him the title of \"Doctor Honoris Causa\", including Yale University. Between 1980 and 1986 he was the president of the Holocaust Memorial Council in the USA, while currently he is a member of many councils. It is worth mentioning that in 1986 his name was engraved on the \"Statue of Liberty\", next to the names of other 11 immigrants to the USA, on the occasion of the 100 year anniversary from its inauguration in New York on the 29th of July 2002. His first book of memoirs, \"La Nuit\", issued in 1958, accounts his experiences in German concentration camps. From that year onwards, he signed almost 40 books, all of them inspired by the ordeal of the Jews during World War II.

Princely Church collapsed in 1628 due to a strong earthquake. Matei Basarab rebuilt it in 1635 with the same stone blocks of the original church and so it will remain until 1827, when the high priest Beldiman Filaret, with the support of Prince Gregory Ghica, remade it for the third time. The Princely Church is princely burial place and preserves the oldest princely gravestone, written in Slavonic, belonging to Nicolae Alexandru Basarab (1352-1364).

It encloses three naves and an elongated semicircular choir towards the East. The external aspect of the Cathedral is determined by the main facade that forges its monumental aspect.

He established also there a printing house, where in the following three years he issued nine books, including three in Romanian and three in the Slavonic - Romanian bilingual edition. He wrote \"Joy Book\" (1706), against Catholics and a Liturgy Book (1706), the first Romanian editions in Wallachia. According to the provisions in the will of Metropolitan Teodosie, who had taught believers in Wallachia for 40 years, on the 22nd of February 1708, Bishop Antim was annointed metropolitan, in the presence of the patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem. He printed at Târgoviște, in a new printing house, 18 books (11 in Romanian), as he introduced the mother tongue in religious activity, achieving what had begun during the time of Matei Basarab (the pattern) and Șerban Cantacuzino (biblical texts). He had published several prayer and liturgy books in 1710, 1712, 1713 and 1715 in the Romanian language. However, three others remained without translations.","County":"București","E-mail address":["manastirea.antim@gmail.com"],"General profile":"Religious Art","Historic Monument Building":"B-II-a-A-18971","Importance":"Local","Locality":"București","Main profile":"Religious Art","Museum code":"5110000007","Name":"\"Metropolitan Bishop Antim Ivireanu\" Old Romanian Art Museum","Phone":["0314.178.078"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/5110000007_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/5110000007_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/5110000007_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/5110000007_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/5110000007_05.jpg"],"Postal code":"040111","Time table":["Monday - Saturday: 11:30 - 16:00","Sunday and feasts: closed"],"Website":["http://manastireaantim.ro/muzeul/"]},{"Address":"Strada P.P.

The Pitesti Penitentiary is known for the Pitesti Phenomenon or the Pitesti Experiment, a period of extreme violence between 1949 and 1951, where about 600 students were thrown by the Communists into the hell of physical, mental and spiritual torture in forms hard to describe. The Pitesti Prison Memorial has recently opened its permanent exhibition, after several years of research and planning, in which a small team attempted to highlight the history of the former Pitesti penitentiary. Thus, centered on the theme of the Pitesti Phenomenon, the exhibition presents to the visitor the context in which the generation that opposed communism was formed, but also the late dictatorship, in which the same generation was thrown with broken wings after years of detention. The building: Architect C. Duțulescu; modern, functional architecture built for the purpose of penitentiary. It was built between 1938 and 1941 at the edge of the Pitesti town, and in 1942 the first political prisoners, pupils imprisoned by the dictator Antonescu’s regime, were brought here. Between 1949 and 1951 the Pitesti phenomenon, one of the most violent forms of psychological and physical torture in the Communist camp, takes place at the Pitesti Prison. The building functions as a mixed prison - political prisoners and common law (women and men) until 1977, when the penitentiary is decommissioned. In the same year it was taken by the Argeș Industrial Construction Trust, and after 1990 the company was privatized, resulting in several private owners of the former prison building. The building has undergone a number of changes in interior partitioning over the years, following its transformation from the penitentiary into an office building. The first blocks have been built in the penitentiary area since the 1950s, and the building is currently in the center of a central district of Pitesti. It is historic monument, A grade.

He was noticed for the first time in 1965, at a contest in Ghelari, and then his stage appearances began to be more frequent. However, his debut on television, although he was already very well known, was made quite late, towards the age of 30, and since then his musical career has been an upward one, becoming a permanent collaborator of Romanian Television. Drăgan Muntean graduated from primary school in his native village, to then complete his studies in Deva, becoming a teacher in the commune of Vețel and in the municipality of residence in Hunedoara county. Then, after graduating from the Police Academy, between 1997 and 2000, he was the director of the \"Ciocârlia\" Ensemble of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but homesickness brought him back to Deva, where, until the end of his life, he served as head of the Bureau of Culture, Education and Traditions within the Hunedoara County Police Inspectorate, having the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

Our efforts have been directed towards the reunification of Romanian culture with the cultural treasure created outside the country, from the years of post-war Romanian exile until now. The project was born from the need and necessity of generating an overview of Romanian spiritual creations, made beyond the country\u0027s borders during the communist regime. The uniqueness of the Museum\u0027s holdings is given by their remarkable diversity, easy to notice, especially through the prism of the fields represented, from the humanities and social sciences, theology and music, to the performing and visual arts, as well as the types of materials that make up each separate collection. In addition to these, the museum exhibits pieces of furniture, personal items and original photographs, as well as unique visual art from painting, sculpture, drawing or engraving. Our institutional efforts therefore aim at the popularization of the works signed by famous names of the Romanian exile and which, until now, have circulated for almost half a century only outside the borders of the country, only a small part being edited and translated into Romanian. Visiting the exhibits one by one, we have the opportunity to look at the handwriting of the authors well-known to us, as it appears in the holographic dedications in the precious books or in the original manuscripts and documents from the libraries of the personalities represented in the Museum, on the correspondence sheets carried by the writers celebrities from exile, revealed for the first time to the public in Romania. Passing from one room to another, we admire pieces of furniture, personal items and original photographs, but also unique visual art from painting, sculpture, drawing or engraving, which allows us to, for a moment, imagine ourselves in the minds of the writers and creators of fine art. The museum offers visitors a foray into the work of some prominent figures of Romanian literature, art, history and culture. Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Ileana and Romulus Vulpescu, Acad.

In the second room, furnished and equipped with museum furniture, objects for field work, clothing, documents, badges, medals and many more are displayed on shelves and in show cases. In the third room, as well as in the access hall are exposed mainly the 166 paintings and sculptures in wood, metal and marble of the late master Gheorghe Roua from Vrăniuț, donated to our museum by his heirs, but also other old, interesting objects. In the lobby there is an exhibition of old musical instruments belonging to the Răcășdia fanfare. In recent years we have tried to complete the dowry of our museum by acquiring various objects that have been donated by the citizens of our commune. REPRESENTATIVE OBJECTS: - men\u0027s specific costume, consisting of trousers, shirt and waistcoat and female costume consisting of blouse, skirt and apron; - Men\u0027s waistcoat specific to the area; - photos, from the interwar period, representing local people from Răcășdia in their folk costume. The day when the photographer came for a family photo was considered an event of major importance in that household; - Household items for domestic use, or required in the field, such as: butter pot - BADANI; water storage vessel - BURI; small balance; pull, cup and glass for brandy - made of specially cultivated pumpkins; - old musical instruments, fanfare - music was a pleasant means of relaxation at the cultural meetings of that period. The Răcășdia band was founded in 1896; - writing instruments: pen and tablet; - wall clock with weights; - collection of badges and medals; - bottles for beer and gaseous water - the glass bottle is inscribed with the name of the locality and the patron who produced, during the interwar period, the gaseous water at Răcășdia; - wool-processing tools and machines - looming while keeping a blanket weaving; - tools and rotary machines - the wood lathe is still in very good shape; - wooden sculptures representing statues, paintings, various figures.

Romanian communism meant, apart from so many dramatic things that “big history” records, a daily attempt to create the “new man” from the first moments of each individual’s existence. This museum aims to record, through a number of exhibits from that period, precisely this “little history”. The permanent exhibition is the result of the effort made by the Iași National Museum of Romanian Literature to bring together and showcase exhibits from that era. Over the years various temporary exhibitions on this topic have been organised: “The Childhood of our Parents” and “The Museum of Daily Life in Communism” (2014), “Propaganda Matters 1.0” (2016).

The Abraham Goldfaden room illustrates, through a manuscript notebook, photographs and posters, the birth of Yiddish theatre in the world and the life of its founder, Abraham Goldfaden, considered the Father of Jewish Theatre. Two halls are dedicated to the beginnings of Jewish theatre (19th and 20th centuries) and contain posters and other original documents, which testify to the performances of Goldfadenʼs troupe around the country, in the period after the performances at the “Pomul Verde” Garden in Iași. The permanent exhibition continues with four rooms dedicated to the State Jewish Theatre of Iași (1949-1963), which contain advertising posters of the institutionʼs first years, a puppet show set, props, programmes, a costume workshop, models of the building demolished in 1963, and a gallery with photographs of the State Jewish Theatre of Iași company. The next two rooms are dedicated to the Barascheum Theatre, a Jewish variety theatre, active in Bucharest between 1941 and 1945. Here the visitors can find photos, a replica of a costume belonging to Sara Kanner, playbills and programmes. The room dedicated to the State Jewish Theatre of Bucharest reflects the history of this cultural institution, established on August 1, 1948, still operating today, with an uninterrupted activity since establishment. Props, photographs, posters, and a screen on which movies and filmed shows will be projected are the main features of this room. The last room is interactive, with the walls lined with posters of Jewish performances in Iași and Bucharest; here, children will be able to interact and engage in various theatre-related activities.","County":"Iași","Director":"Lucian Dan Teodorovici","E-mail address":["muzeul.literaturii@gmail.com"],"Fax":["0232.410.340"],"General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"IS-II-m-B-03704","Importance":"County","Locality":"Iași","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"69465066","Name":"House of Museums.

The Iași Pogrom was an operation devised at the top of the Antonescu administration and put into practice by Romanian and German army units, with the participation of some of the civilians in the city. The anti-Semitic psychosis, deliberately fuelled by the civilian and military secret services, contributed decisively to the preparation of the Pogrom of June 29, 1941. The digging of mass graves in the Jewish cemetery in Păcurari, before the violent anti-Semitic outbreak, proves the planned nature of the assassination. The Prefecture, the Police Headquarters, echelons of the Romanian army and gendarmerie, the railway company regional office in Iași have contributed to the killing in cold blood of over 13,000 out of the total of 35,000 Jews living in Iași in those years. The Police Headquarters yard and the two death trains were the main places of extermination for the Jews of Iași. Of the 4,400 Jews aboard the two cargo trains, 2,590 died. The first train, travelling from Iași to Călărași, left on Monday, June 30, and after six and a half days on a convoluted route, it reached its destination. The second train, Iași - Podu Iloaiei, covered a distance of 20 kilometres in eight hours. There were no stops on this route, but the train moved so slowly that the escort often walked along the moving train. In October 2010, a team of historians, archaeologists and communicators from the “Elie Wiesel” Institute, armed with archival documents and the testimonies of locals, discovered a mass grave in the Vulturi Forest, in the village of Popricani, Iasi county. A total of 36 civilian victims were found and extracted: 12 children, nine women, 15 men aged between one and 80. An investigation was carried out by the Iași Military Prosecutorʼs Office in file 271 / P / 2010 and by the Military Prosecutorʼs Office attached to the Bucharest Military Court of Appeal in file 12 / P / 2014. In June 2019, another team found a second mass grave in an area close to the place where the first had been found. The investigation showed that it appeared to contain 22 civilian victims - six children, 12 women and four men. The most probable hypothesis: the victims were Jews arrested in Sculeni, the Republic of Moldova, and taken inside Romania by the Romanian army (6th Infantry Regiment) during the Barbarossa operation. The exhibition halls dedicated to the Iași Pogrom contain photographs taken during the Pogrom, a hologram, survivors’ testimonies, documents and artefacts.","County":"Iași","Director":"Lucian Dan Teodorovici","E-mail address":["muzeul.literaturii@gmail.com"],"Fax":["0232.410.340"],"General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"IS-II-m-B-03704","Importance":"County","Locality":"Iași","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"69465065","Name":"House of Museums.

Here was a literary circle, the headquarters of the \"Junimea\" Literary Society (since 1863) and \"Convorbiri Literare\" (\"Literary Conversations\") magazine (1867 - 1885). The house was bought in 1901 by Princess Maria Moruzzi who modified the main entry to the house, and changed the façades by fixing above the balconies her family coat of arms. The house was inherited by her son, George Brătianu who in 1938, on his departure for Bucharest, rented it to the Royal Residence in Jassy. It was restored in 1968 with a view to turning it into a literature museum and repaired again after the 1977 earthquake. The museum presents the development of Romanian literature, especially that of Moldavia, from 1800 to the present. The building comprises nine rooms, ground floor and upper floor, and two large halls. It presents the main literary periods of the past two centuries: the period of the classical writers Costache Conachi, Vasile Alecsandri, and Alexandru Donici; the \"Dacia Literară\" (\"Literary Dacia\") Salon; the writers of the Revolution of 1848 and the Union of 1859; the foundation of the \"Junimea\" Society of Titu Maiorescu and the \"Junimea\" writers (Titu Maiorescu, Vasile Pogor, P.P.

Although the space existing in the school is not enough to exhibit all the objects and only those that are valuable from historical point of view. Thus, they have been exhibited in small selections that make up the permanent exhibition of the school museum. The Archaeological Collection is made up of artifacts from the Stone Age to Modern times, discovered in the sites of the our county, or other sites in the country. The Coin Collection of the school museum is made up of Romanian coins or banknotes alongside with a lot of decorations and medals issued on various anniversaries of national and international historical events. Although the school is located in the middle of the city, we considered it necessary to arrange an Ethnographic room, specific for the Vlașca area, made up of a collection of weavings, wooden furniture, ceramics, folk costumes and household objects. Local history is illustrated by various collections: old books, technical corner, military history, “Teohari Antonescu” museum in Giurgiu, with which we still cooperate. The three-rooms of the museum in the school is used both as an attraction for the visitors and resource for teaching and documentary aide for the History and Romanian literature classes. The museum of School no. 4 ”Mihai Eminescu” was visited by many people keen on history and by personalities from Romania and abroad, their impressions being written in the “Golden Book” of the school museum.","Contact person":"prof.dr.

It was established in Jassy in 1856 as the first Botanic Garden in Romania by the doctor and naturalist Anastasie Fatu, a great patriot, philanthropist and cultivated man. The Systematic Sector stretching over five hectares cultivates about 2,000 taxa, herbal and ligneous plants arranged according to their natural relation as phyla, branches, orders and families. Romanian flora and vegetation is the largest sector stretching over 25 hectares. The Ornamental (Decorative) Sector lies at thee main entranceway to the Botanic Garden, all around the administrative pavilion and the greenhouse complex. The Ornamental Sector stretches over a four hectare ground and 800.19 sq.m. surface, greenhouse surface, as well as over 72.60 sq.m. solarium, destined to the collections that need close spaces to be cultivated and preserved, as well as to the soil culture of some rare exotic plants for cut flowers. The Dendrologic Sector (dendrarium) lies in the south end of the Botanic Garden, on a slope with a west general exhibition and an average declivity of seven - eight degrees. This sector stretches over 20 hectares. The World Flora Sector stretches over 16 hectares, on both sides of \"Podgoria Copou\" Valley, starting from the neighbourhood of Turn greenhouse (greenhouse 9) and up to the Copou valleys. The Biological Sector lies in the central part of the Botanic Garden stretching over 4.5 hectares. The Utilitarian Plants Sector stretches over 1.5 hectares and lies on the central plateau of the Botanic Garden, bordering to the north-east the Systematic Sector, to the west the Biological Sector, to the south the Dendrologic Sector and to the south-east the Rosarium. The glass and metal constructions, with air-conditioning, stretch over a surface of about 3,800 sq.m. The precinct shelters a remarkable stock of original plants (about 2,600 taxa), especially from subtropical and equatorial areas of the globe, from all the continents. Their distribution runs according to well established criteria: biogeographical, taxonomic, utilitarian, etc. The Greenhouse Complex Sector comprises 12 greenhouses, each of them with its own characteristics, comprising various vegetal materials. The Rosarium and Roses\u0027 Park is situated at the crossroads between the main sectors and access ways, stretching over 1.7 hectares and summing up 600 types of roses, distributed into horticultural groups according to size, shape and colour. In the centre of the rosarium there are the species of noble roses, and at the peripheral areas one can find the species of wild species, distributed according to their geographical origin. The Botanic Garden also comprises a memorial plants sector stretching over three hectares. The Memorial Plants Sector lies not far from the historic monument - \"St. Atanasie and Chiril\" Church (1638), built by Prince Vasile Lupu.","County":"Iași","Director":"Mihai Mititiuc","E-mail address":["gbot.is@uaic.ro"],"Fax":["0232.201.385"],"Founded":"1965","General profile":"Natural Sciences","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Iași","Main profile":"Natural Sciences - Botanics","Museum code":"7412200","Name":"\"Anastasie Fătu\" Botanic Garden","Phone":["0232.201.373"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7412200_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7412200_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7412200_03.jpg"],"Postal code":"700487","Time table":["In the greenhouse and outside: 9:00 - 20:00","In the herbarium room: Monday to Friday, 9:00 - 15:00"],"Website":["http://botanica.uaic.ro/index.htm"]},{"Access":"Line 3 from the Railways Station","Address":"Bulevardul Independenței nr. 16","Administrative subordination":"“Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d418\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-Naturala-al-Universitatii-Iasi-Iasi","Collection(s)":"The Natural History Museum in Jassy was established on the 4th of February 1834, upon the initiative of a few members of the Society of Physicians and Naturalists in Jassy, headed by Iacob Cihac, Gheorghe Asachi, Mihail Zotta, Constantin Sturza and Costache Negri. It is the first museum of this kind founded in the Principalities. In 1840 they bought for the museum the house of the high official Costachi Sturza, on Hagioaiei Street, today 16 Independence Avenue. The museum and the Society have conducted their activity in that building ever since. The building, known also as Roset House, was built by the end of the 18th century in the neoclassical style, and it is currently one of the few architectonic monuments of Jassy that includes in its structure a vaulted ground floor. The museum preserves in its collections pieces donated by early 19th century by Metropolitan Veniamin Costachi (a mammoth bones and hairy rhinoceros collection that used to hang as counterweight at the well sweep in Râșca, Fălticeni district), Prince Mihail Sturza (the Indian elephant Gaba, purchased for the sum of 135 ducats), Iacob Cihac, agha Alecu Balș, Gheorghe Asachi a.s.o. The Natural History Room became known to the general public also due to the fact that in one of its halls, the National Party deputies, on the night of the 3rd/15th of January 1859, elected colonel Alexandru Ioan Cuza as candidate to the reign of Moldavia. The exhibits include historical objects and pieces of furniture, the portraits of those who lay the foundation of the museum and of the Society, of the personalities who conducted their activity in the museum over the years: Iacob Cihac, Grigore Cobălcescu, Anastasie Fătu, Petru Poni, etc. Currently the museum collections count over 300,000 items. The most valuable include: Insects, Mollusks, Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds, Minerals and Plants. In 1840, when the museum moved to the current building, the museum heritage consisted in: 1,500 minerals, 2,844 plants, 3,000 mollusks and insects, 735 vertebrates, and 92 skeletons. The oldest piece in the museum collection is the Indian elephant, that was purchased in 1835 by Prince Grigore Mihail Sturza and brought to the palace, and later donated to the museum. In 2000 the museum inventory counted over 350,000 artefacts, including 3,500 heritage items (5,290 on display and the others stored). The Mollusk Collection comprises almost all the Lamellibranchiate and Gastropoda in Romanian fauna. The Arachnida (spider) Collection is one of the largest in this country; it comprises specimens from Dobrudja, Moldavia and Bukovina. The largest insect collections are Orthoptera, Odonates, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Neuroptera. The Coleoptera include over 50,000 specimens and the best represented families are: Staphylinidae, Meloidae, Cerambicidae and Scarabeidae. The vertebrates collection includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, counting over 14,000 specimens, comprising almost all the species existing in this country and thus making up one of the richest collections in our museums. The nest and egg collections are remarkable. The palaeontology collection counts over 10,000 specimens, and the mineral one over 2,900 samples.","County":"Iași","Director":"Ioan Cojocaru","E-mail address":["grigore@uaic.ro"],"Founded":"1834","General profile":"Natural Sciences","Historic Monument Building":"IS-II-m-B-03917","Importance":"Regional","Locality":"Iași","Main profile":"Natural Sciences - Geology, Zoology","Museum code":"7412100","Name":"Natural History Museum of Iași University","Phone":["0232.201.339"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7412100_01.jpg"],"Postal code":"700101","Time table":["Monday: closed","Tuesday-Sunday: 10:00-17:00"],"Website":["http://www.bio.uaic.ro/muzeu/muzeu.html"]},{"Access":"Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași, Department of Geology, 2nd floor","Address":"Bulevardul Carol I nr. 20 A, et.

The Paleontological and Stratigraphical Museum of \"Babeș-Bolyai\" University has a long history and a rich scientific tradition. It emerged as an academic collection in 1919, by partially taking over the collections of Francis Joseph University (inaugurated in 1872.). The collections were later reorganized and enriched with samples donated by geology professors and students. The exchanges conducted with museums and collectors in this country and abroad also contribute to the continuous diversification of the museum heritage. The museum currently has a number of about 50,000 samples, grouped in the following collections: The taxonomic paleontology collection gathers a systematic arrangement of fossil plants, invertebrates and vertebrates in this country and abroad. The most valuable collection is the specimen one and includes over 200 species of fossil plants and animals, representing new species for science and described for the first time in Romania.

Înființat în 1859, ca o secție a Muzeului Ardelean, muzeul și-a sporit treptat zestrea, numărând în prezent peste 200.000 de piese. Un rol deosebit, l-a avut și Expediția Română Transafricană din 1971, la care au participat și cercetători clujeni și de pe urma căreia s-au putut face numeroase completări cu piese exotice originare africane. Muzeul Zoologic este format din mai multe colecții științifice de animale (colecția malacologică Biltz, colecția lepidopterologică Franzenau, colecția de izopode Radu etc.). Ca valoare științifică și după numărul de exemplare conservate, muzeul se situează pe locul al doilea, după Muzeul \"Gr. Antipa\", din București. Muzeul este împărțit în trei zone: expoziția propriu-zisă, ce cuprinde un număr mare de vertebrate și nevertebrate, expuse izolat sau în diorame și microdiorame care reproduc cadrul natural; colecțiile științifice, care cuprind peste 300.000 exemplare de animale (din care majoritatea sunt insecte), și care sunt accesibile doar specialiștilor; rezerva muzeului, a cărui material biologic este expus temporar sau se completează expoziția. Exponatele se prezintă sub mai multe forme de conservare împăiate, uscate, preparate în lichide conservante și schelete. Piesele expuse, sunt aranjate atât în ordine filogenetică, reflectând de la simplu la complex evoluția regnului animal, cât și sub formă de diorame, arătând în acest fel interrelațiile dintre speciile care formează lumea animală. Pe lângă speciile autohtone, o mare parte din exponate sunt din fauna exotică, cum este de exemplu, colecția de corali, scoica-de-perle (Meleagrina margaritifera), scorpionul african (Pandinus imperator), fluturele migrator Monarh (Danaus plexipus), o varietate întreagă de stele-de-mare, pești Dipnoi, peștele-electric african (Malapterurus electricus), mâna Sfântului Petru (Zeus Faber mauritanicus), șarpele sud-american surucucu (Lachesis atrox), o specie de șarpe marin (Pelamis bicolor), dropia-gulerată (Chlamydotis undulata), găinușa de deșert (Sierrapthes paradoxus), pasărea paradisului (Paradisea apoda), tucanul (Ramphasthos toco), cangurii (Protemnodon rufogrissea), ursulețul-spălător (Procyon lotor), girafa (Giraffa camelopardalis), mangusta (Herpestes ichneumon), grupul de feline mari (Felis leo, F. tigris, Panthera onca) și multe altele. De asemenea avem expuse și animale care reprezintă rarități, specii dispărute, sau endemisme, ca de exemplu nautilul (Nautilus sp.), relict din era primară, care se găsește doar in Oceanul Pacific, (Lymulus polyphemus) singura formă actuală din grupul demult dispărut al Trilobiților, asperetele (Romanychtis valsanicola), care se găsește doar în apele râului Vâlsan și câțiva afluenți, tuatara (Sphenonon punctatus) care trăiește în Noua Zeelandă și care este rudă cu reptilele preistorice, pasărea kiwi (Apterix oeweni) tot din Noua Zeelandă, porumbelul-evantai (Goura victoria) vulturul-bărbos (Gypaetus barbatus) și vulturul pleșuv (Aegypius monachus) ambele specii dispărute definitiv din fauna țării noastre, ornitorincul (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) și echidna (Zaglosus brujnei) din Australia. Aspectele comportamentale ale vieții animalelor sunt relevate în mai multe moduri. Spre exemplu, avem expuse insectare tematice în care sunt arătate variațiile de talie ale fluturilor în anotimpul ploios și secetos, aspecte de homocromie copiantă și mimetism la fluturi și larve și de asemenea etape ale elaborării firului de mătase la fluturele-de-mătase (Bombix mori). De asemenea, viața păsărilor de stufăriș, cu tipurile de cuiburi pe care acestea le construiesc, precum și diorama cu fauna câmpiei Bărăganului, alcătuiesc o zonă informațională sugestivă. Exemplarele de colibri, atrag atenția prin variația coloritului schimbător în funcție de lumina care cade pe corpul lor cât și prin felul cum se hrănesc. De un interes deosebit este și microdiorama în care se află expuși grangurii (Oriolus oriolus). Aici este prezentat atât fenomenul de dicromism sexual, precum și locul în care este construit cuibul și ponta. O dioramă deosebit de reprezentativă este și cea în care este arătată lupta pentru existență pe timp de iarnă într-o pădure din zona noastră, și care alcătuiește totodată un spațiu explicativ bine documentat. În ceea ce privește colecțiile științifice, acestea sunt depozitate în majoritate într-o sală. Mai există însă și colecții tematice expuse în sălile muzeului.","Contact person":"Ceuca Delia","County":"Cluj","E-mail address":["dceuca@biolog.ubbcluj.ro"],"Founded":"1859","General profile":"Natural Sciences","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Cluj-Napoca","Main profile":"Natural Sciences - Zoology","Museum code":"7411100","Name":"Zoological Museum of the \"Babeș-Bolyai\" University","Phone":["0264.595.739 (int.121)"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7411100_05.jpg"],"Position":"Muzeograf","Postal code":"400006","Time table":["Tuesday - Friday: 10:00 - 16:00","Saturday, Sunday: 10:00 - 14:00","Monday closed"],"Website":["http://muzee.ubbcluj.ro/muzee/muzeul-zoologic"]},{"Accreditation":["O.M.C.C. nr. 2056/07.02.2008","O.M.C. nr. 2736/12.12.2013 Reacreditare O.M.C.I.N. nr. 2073/04.02.2019 Reacreditare"],"Address":"Strada Londra nr. 39, sector 1","Administrative subordination":"Ministry of Culture","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d749\u0026-Muzeul-National-al-Hartilor-si-Cartii-Vechi-Bucuresti","Collection(s)":"The exhibits include 667 maps, engravings, drawings, lithographs, as well as a series of artefacts specific of the museum themes.

The medieval part of the Cotroceni National Museum is represented by the spaces built during the reign of the voivode Șerban Cantacuzino (1678-1688). Between May 26, 1679 and August 24, 1682 - data found in the inscription on the church door frame and in the one next to the fresco of the founders - the church, the monks\u0027 cells, the royal palace, the abbot\u0027s houses, all these constructions forming the Cotroceni Monastery, the founder\u0027s residence . Currently, in the Cotroceni National Museum you can visit the kitchen of the former Cotroceni Monastery, the refectory (dining room), a few cells and two spaces belonging to the former royal palace, representative spaces for the construction technique and for the Romanian architecture from the end of the century. 17th century (Great Cellar and Small Cellar). The beginning of the modern era was marked, in 1821, by the settlement of Tudor Vladimirescu\u0027s camp on the Cotrocenilor plateau. During the 1848 revolution, the Ottoman army led by Fuad-Efendi occupied the Cotroceni Monastery. The reign of Barbu Știrbey (1849-1853) proved beneficial to the area, the ruler restoring and redecorating the royal palace that became his summer residence. At the same time, in order to facilitate the connection with the Capital, the ruler Știrbey cut a new road, which sectioned the great park of the monastery, thus separating the princely area from that of the future Botanical Garden, whose beginnings date back to 1860. After the 1977 earthquake, restoration work began and lasted about 10 years. From July 12, 1991, by government decision, the old wing of the Cotroceni Palace (in the new wing, built since 1980, the Presidential Administration currently operates) was transformed into a museum - the Cotroceni National Museum, open to the public on December 27, 1991. Today, the Cotroceni National Museum, a leading cultural institution in the cultural landscape of Bucharest, aims to continue its mission, that of being a space for debate and artistic dialogue, and on the other hand, to support initiatives on the restoration process, preservation and capitalization of the national cultural heritage, as a way of promoting the national identity, in close connection with the academic environment and the civil society.","Contact person":"Mariana Lazăr","County":"București","Director":"Ana-Maria Ludatșer","E-mail address":["secretariat@muzeulcotroceni.ro","relatiipublice@muzeulcotroceni.ro","vizitare@muzeulcotroceni.ro"],"Fax":["021.312.16.18"],"Founded":"1991","General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"B-II-a-A-19152","Importance":"National","Locality":"București","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"7300500","Name":"Cotroceni National Museum","Phone":["021.317.31.06 (relații publice)","021.317.31.07 (programări vizite)","021.317.31.00 (secretariat)"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300500_14.jpg"],"Position":"Șef Secție Cercetare și Programe Editoriale","Postal code":"060116","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"],"Website":["http://www.muzeulcotroceni.ro"]},{"Address":"Strada Locotenent Aviator Gheorghe Caranda 79","Administrative subordination":"Private Museum/Collection","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2100\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Pictor-Alexandru-Tipoia”-Bucuresti","Collection(s)":"Alexandru Țipoia Memorial House-Museum is located in the house of the artist and his family, from Lt.

Other fine art works can be seen in the most important room of the house, the novelist\u0027s study, achieved by prestigious artists of the time (Steriadi, Milița Pătrașcu, I. Jalea, Fr. Șirato). In the room where the daughter of the two writers once lived we can see family photographs, a few paintings, and a beautiful collection of icons that span a wall, giving the impression of a catapetasma. The largest space of the museum is the dining-room, furnished with an impressive Biedermeyer furniture, in which the collection of icons continues, where there is also a timepiece with socle, a unique object. In the kitchen, an impressive collection of ceramics (specific of the Transylvanian area) covers the walls.","County":"București","Director":"Ioan Cristescu","Founded":"1992","General profile":"Memorials","Importance":"County","Locality":"București","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"7300406","Name":"\"Liviu Rebreanu and Fanny Rebreanu\" Memorial House","Part of":"National Museum of the Romanian Literature","Phone":["021.317.90.42"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300406_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300406_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300406_03.jpg"],"Postal code":"050482","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 18:00 (summer) / 09:00 - 17.00 (winter)","Monday - closed."],"Website":["https://mnlr.ro/case-memoriale/casa-memoriala-liviu-si-fanny-rebreanu/"]},{"Access":"Trolley bus: 61, 69, 90, 91 (Faculty of Medicine Station); 96 (station Eroilor); 62, 71, 93 (Botanic Garden station); Bus: 306, 336 (Faculty of Medicine Station).","Address":"Bulevardul Dr. Gheorghe Marinescu nr. 19, et. 2, ap. 12, sector 5, interfon 5","Administrative subordination":"Bucharest City Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d17\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Ion-Minulescu”-Bucuresti","Collection(s)":"The memorial house, comprising a five room flat and annexes, is dedicated to the poet Ion Minulescu..

Panaitescu - Perpessicius, who was also its first manager. Its first location had been in Toma Stelian House, in 10 Kiseleff Highway. In 1967 the museum was relocated in the Scarlat Kretzulescu House (attested in 1839), a historic monument, built by justice of the peace Alexandru Villara and offered as dowry to his daughter, Elena, on her marriage to Scarlat Kretzulescu. After the death of the latter, the house was sold to the banker Franc, director of Bank of Romania. At the beginning of the 20th century, the building was nationalized and functioned, by turn, as electricity laboratory of the University of Bucharest, boarding-school for girls, the library of the German Embassy in Bucharest and, after World War II, the Romanian - Russian Museum. It is one of the few Bucharest buildings in a neo-classical style. The house was rebuilt, and recently entirely restored. În June 2014 the collections, library and personnel of the museum had to leave the building and was temporarely stored at Casa Presei Libere 1, in a former printing house reserve. In April 2017, the permanent exhibition of the museum was reopened in a restored building in the centre of Bucharest, on 8, Nicolae Crețulescu Str. The museum has 300,000 items, organized in 300 collections (manuscripts, documents, letters, original photographs, fine arts, memorials), 200 titles of old Romanian books, 20,000 rare books, 8000 periodicals.

Spiru Haret had the idea of founding such a museum, that was established on the 1st of October 1906 as an autonomous folk art museum: the Museum of Ethnography, National Art, Decorative and Industrial Art located in the building of the former Treasury. The outstanding art historian Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was appointed director. He conferred a prestigious scientific and cultural status to the institution, and changed its name first to the Museum of Ethnography and National Art, and in 1912 to the Museum of National Art. In 1931 the folk art exhibition was inaugurated. In 1953 it moved to the Știrbei Palace building, in Calea Victoriei, where it functioned for 25 years, under the name of the Museum of Folk Art of the Republic, under the leadership of Tancred Bănățeanu, a remarkable ethnographer. In 1978 it merged with the Village Museum under the name of the Village and Folk Art Museum. In 1990 the museum, bearing the current name, returned to the former premises. The building, listed as a monument of architecture, sheltering the Romanian Peasant Museum, was built by the arhitect Nicolae Ghika-Budești, a brilliant representative of the Romanian architecture school. The museum presents costumes, pottery, furniture, wooden and glass icons, xylographs, religious items, fabrics, carpets, tools, as well as an important collection of foreign folk art, emerged due to the endeavours of the ethnographer Tancred Bănățeanu. All the collections include about 90,000 items, 70,000 artefacts from the old collection and 20,000 acquired after 1990. The display of the permanent exhibition is innovative and original. After 1990 six wooden churches in danger from the Arad and Hunedoara counties were acquired, four of them conserved \"in situ\", and two, in the museum precinct.

Zambaccian, Anastase Simu, Dr. Dona, the selection of works from the Vasile Grigore donation comprises works of Romanian interwar painting, sculpture and graphics (Theodor Pallady, Gheorghe Petrașcu, Iosif Iser, NicolaeTonitza) and contemporary ones (Alexandru Ciucurencu, Comeliu Baba, Gheorghe Vanatoru, Ion Musceleanu, Lucian Grigorescu, Constantin Blendea, Henry Catargi, Ion Popescu Negreni, Ion Irimescu, Mihai Buculei, Vladimir Predescu, Traian Bradean, Jean AI.

The master’s love for Romanian folk art and his passion of collecting authentic objects finally developed into a special ethnographic collection, merging various kinds of art: wooden and glass icons, pottery, religious objects and, last but not least, rugs completing the display of the hall. The link with world art is discrete and always seen through the perspective of Romanian art. The selection of Japanese prints, including famous artists such as Hiroshige, Utamaro, Kunisada, reflects the strong power of lines, like in Romanian graphics. The porcelain pieces, painted by hand or printed, from Japan or China, impress by their bright colours and sophistication of the surfaces of the pieces. The Delft English pottery, the German, Russian or French faience are a few of the types of the collection. The domestic artefacts also include engraved, hammered, stamped or perforated metal pieces. Harmoniously coloured, the Oriental prayer carpets suggest a historical reality in almost all the museum halls. Inlaid, intarsiated or painted, the pieces of furniture reveal the great craftsmanship and sensitivity of French, Dutch or Japanese cabinet-makers. Its collection of disks, as well as the library, important parts of the donation, completes it, while suggesting with great accuracy the trends that influenced both the artist and the collector.","County":"București","Director":"Viorel Mihail Rău","E-mail address":["muzeul_v_grigore@yahoo.com"],"Fax":["021.211.54.09"],"Founded":"2003","General profile":"Arts","Importance":"National","Locality":"București","Main profile":"Art","Museum code":"7300212","Name":"\"Vasile Grigore - Painter and Collector\" Art Museum","Phone":["021.211.54.09"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300212_16.jpg"],"Postal code":"020482","Time table":["Monday - Friday: 11:00 - 16:00","Saturday, Sunday: closed"],"Website":["http://mavg.ro/"]},{"Address":"Strada Spătarului nr. 22, sector 2","Administrative subordination":"National","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d716\u0026-Muzeul-„Theodor-Pallady”-Bucuresti","Collection(s)":"The museum holds a few remarkable canvases by the great Romanian painter Theodor Pallady, as well as a lot of over 800 drawings (landscapes, nudes, portraits, interiors), representative for Pallady\u0027s Parisian period.

The Brancovan Palace of Mogoșoaia was first documented on the 24th of Aprilie 1698. The construction was completed on the 20 September 1702 (as the inscription above the main door reads). Stephen, son of Prince Constantine Brancovan lived in the palace. Set by the lakeside, in a rectangular courtyard surrounded by strong walls, the palace has a rectangular, regular plan, having three storeys: basement (cellar), ground floor and upper floor. The cellar is remarkable due to its sizes and solidness. A central pillar divides the space into four rooms, each covered by a cupola with pendants. The ground floor comprises eight rooms for the prince\u0027s servants, while the entire upper floor used to be inhabited by the princely family. At the upper storey, on the facade looking aut the lake, there is the most refined architectural element of the palace: the magnificent loggia, Venetian in style, with three arches. Nowadays it is framed by two turrets, added during the restoration from 1860 - 1880, that can be remarked due to their columns with capitals carved in stone. In addition, the turret on the east side of the palace stands on eight stone columns, with a richly decorated balustrade. The vault of the turret had been covered with mural painting with geometric and floral motifs, of which a few fragments are extant. On the upper floor, probably in the High Spatharus hall, there is a large fresco depicting, on two meter panels each, the travel of the prince to Adrianopolis, in 1703, and his encounter with the sultan. Fragments from this fresco were still extant by the middle of the 19th century, but most paintings, stuccos and interior decorations were destroyed by the Turks in 1775. The rich inlaid work mingles stylistic elements characteristic both of the Renaissance and the Baroque. Nowadays Mogoșoaia estate comprises an English park, with Italian style gardens, a courtyard where there are the palace, kitchen, ice house, gate tower (before 1702), the guest house (the 17th century, 1927 - 1936 restorations), and outside it \"N. Bibescu\" greenhouses (1890), \"St. George\" Chapel (1688), and \"Gheorghe Bibescu\" Chapel (the 19th century).

The European Art Gallery, Romanian Old Art Gallery, Romanian Modern Art Gallery sum up works displayed in an attractive modern manner, and any visit is a pleasant, interesting way to spend time. The history borne by the building makes the visit a travel in time, as on the place where the Kretzulescu wings stands today, the boyar Dinicu Golescu raised, between 1812 and 1820, a house of impressive size for the contemporaries. During the time of Alexandru Ioan Cuza the building turned into a princely lodging, and during the time of Charles I, a winter palace. The king adorned it after his taste and was also involved with developing a painting collection, today the core of the European Art Gallery. The palace underwent a stage of modifications during the time of Ferdinand and Charles II, and its changed in 1948, when it was decided to open here a museum of art and the reception halls of the central body were assigned to the State Council. During the events of December 1989, eighty per cent of the building was damaged, and over 1,000 works of art were deteriorated or destroyed. In 1990 the building in Revolution Square turned into the National Museum of Art of Romania. The European Art Gallery, sheltered in the Kretzulescu wing, reflects, due to the distribution of the 300 works, the main art schools of Europe between the 14th and 19th centuries. From the late Gothic and the Renaissance, continuing with Mannerism and Caravagism, up to the Baroque and Rococo patterns, Italian painting is represented by works of the masters Domenico Veneziano, Jacopo Bassano, Bronzino, Jacopo Tintoretto, Luca Giordano, Orazio Gentileschi, Jacopo Amigoni. The German art collection illustrates the German version of the international Gothic or the north Renaissance pattern due to remarkable works by Bartholomäus Zeitblom, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans von Aachen. Religious fervour and burning temperament characterize the Spanish paintings by El Greco, Francisco Zurbarán, Alonso Cano, Antonio Pereda. Realism, the mystery of the light and shade or the epic picturesque of the scenes can be found in the works of Flemish artists (Bartholomäus Spranger, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Pieter Paul Rubens, David Ryckaert III) and Dutch artists (Rembrandt Harmensz, Van Rijn, Jan Davidsz, De Heem). The French art halls are spanned by works from the 16th - 19th centuries. Important artists include: J.B. Oudry, Nicolas de Largillière, Gaspar Dughet, Joseph Parrocel, next to Claude Monet, Paul Signac, Alfred Sisley. The sculpture collection includes remarkable creations by Auguste Rodin, Antoine Bourdelle, Jules Dalou and Camille Claudel. The Romanian Old Art Gallery includes 900 pieces offering a unitary image upon the cultural life in the historical provinces: Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania from the 14th - 18th centuries. Remarkable are the fresco fragments (those from Curtea de Argeș [Argeș Court] - 1526) and the icons (Wailing the Lord) - the 15th 16th centuries, Saints Simeon and Sava - 1522 - 1523, both from the monastery of Curtea de Argeș, the Virgin with Child surrounded by prophets - the second half of the 16th century, Pangarati monastery), embroideries (Epitaphs of Cozia Monastery - 1395 -1396 and of Neamt Monastery - 1437, the Air of \"St. Nicholas of Rădăuți\" Church - about 1493, the Stoles of Tismana Monastery - early 16th century), manuscripts (the Four Gospels, achieved in a Byzantine workshop, whose text dates from the 12th century, the Four Gospels of Gavril Uric - 1436 - 1437, the Four Gospels of monk Dimitrie Gramaticul - 1512), gold and silver items (the censer from Tismana - 1508-1512, the shrine from Hurezi - 1691 -1692, the precious metal vessel with artistic incrustations from Precista Monastery in Bacău - 1491 - 1496, the procession cross from Slatina Monastery - 1558), wooden and stone sculptures (the imperial doors from the church in Cârligul (Bacău) - early 16th century, the rib with the coats of arms of Moldavia from \"Three Hierachs\" in Jassy, 1637 - 1638). The gallery includes a Treasure to which three halls are dedicated, where one can see secular and religious items out of precious metals and stones, jewels and costume accessories from the 14th - 19th centuries. The Romanian Modern Art Gallery reconstructs due to the 700 paintings and sculptures the path of Romanian art from early 19th century - illustrated by the departure from the religious art of Byzantine inspiration - to the age of the great classics of Romanian art. The two centuries of art, revealed by numerous artistic trends and tendencies, are represented both by famous names, relevant for the entire Romanian culture, and by less known outstanding artists included for the first time in the permanent exhibition of the National Gallery. The tradition of portraits and the formalism of the \"painters of thin\" are illustrated in the Gallery by the works of Anton Chladek, Giovanni Schiavoni, Iosef August Schoefft, while Theodor Aman\u0027 and Gheorghe Tattarescu\u0027s paintings show how these two artists gave Romanian painting a new interpretation of academicism and neoclassicism. Outstanding personalities of national art like Nicolae Grigorescu, Ioan Andreescu, Ștefan Luchian, Nicolae Tonitza, Theodor Pallady, Gheorghe Petrașcu, Constantin Brâncuși, Dimitrie Paciurea, Corneliu Baba, Alexandru Ciucurencu, Ion Țuculescu, many other artists complete the general configuration of the represented period, including: Iosif Iser, Camil Ressu, Francisc Sirato, Ștefan Dumitrescu, Ion Jalea, Jean Al. Steriadi, Nicolae Darascu, Samuel Mützner, Petre Iorgulescu Yor, Dimitrie Gheață, Rudolf Schweitzer-Cumpăna, Lucian Grigorescu, etc. The constant tendency of Romanian culture to intertwine with European trends is revealed in the Romanian modern art exhibition by the vanguard works of Victor Brauner, Marcel Iancu, Hans Mattis-Teutsch, M. H. Maxy, Arthur Segal. One of the halls of the gallery is dedicated exclusively to the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși and gathers youth and maturity works, such as: Ordeal, Child\u0027s Head, Sleep, Prometheus, Prayer, Danaid, Silence of the Earth.","County":"București","Director":"Călin Stegerean","E-mail address":["secretariat@art.museum.ro (secretariat)","educatie@art.museum.ro (programe educative și vizite ghidate)","cristina.verona@art.museum.ro","Relații publice: comunicare@art.museum.ro"],"Fax":["021.312.43.27"],"Founded":"1948","General profile":"Arts","Historic Monument Building":"B-II-m-A-19856","Importance":"National","Locality":"București","Main profile":"Art","Museum code":"7300200","Name":"National Museum of Art of Romania","Phone":["021.313.30.30 (centrala)","021.314.81.19 (relații publice)"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300200_11.jpg"],"Postal code":"010063","Social media":["https://www.facebook.com/MuzeulNationalDeArtaAlRomaniei"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1664\u0026-Muzeul-„Dr.-Ioan-si-Nicolae-Kalinderu”-Bucuresti","Museum code":"7300209","Name":"\"Dr. Ioan and Nicolae Kalinderu\" Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d698\u0026-Muzeul-„K.H.-Zambaccian”-Bucuresti","Museum code":"7300206","Name":"The \"K.

The museum was established in the Post Palace, one of the most remarkable monuments of architecture in the capital, built in the neoclassical style by the architect Alexandru Săvulescu during the 19th century and restored between 1969 and 1970. The museum collections have 690,099 artefacts, including archaeological finds - 79,280, history items - 191,114, coins - 338.711, rare books - 755, and 80,239 stamps. The museum collections constantly grow due to donations, acquisitions and new archaeological finds. The collection of metal and precious or semiprecious stones from the modern age of the history of Romania often reflects new preferences and tastes, prevailing trends of western decorative styles and manners. The exhibits reveal above all the historic value, their direct link to events and outstanding personalities of Romanian political life, including: personal belongings and authority tokens of Alexandru Ioan Cuza and King Charles I; the crowns of Queens Elisabeth and Mary; the sceptre worn by King Ferdinand, in October 1922, when he was crowned as sovereign of Greater Romania; the sceptre of King Charles II; the gold and platinum jewels with precious and semiprecious stones from the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. In a newly built building body there is the Lapidarium, comprising, on two levels, Greek, Roman and mediaeval monuments. The first level is reserved exclusively to the cast copy of Trajan’s Column, achieved at the scale 1:1 after the original Column in Rome. The cast copies are the work of Vatican craftsmen and was made between 1939 and 1943, and brought to Bucharest in 1967. The monument depicts the history of Trajan’s Dacian wars, waged between 101 - 102 and 105 - 106 AD. There are 2,500 figures on a frieze spanning about 200 m, grouped into 155 scenes. The socle of the Column sheltered the urn of Emperor Trajan and Empress Plotina. The upper level of this construction shelters various exhibits: honorific, funerary, juridical and votive monuments, statues as well as Hellenistic, Roman and mediaeval architectural pieces. The contemporary history department is under restoration, spanning five halls on the second floor of the museum. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.","Contact person":"Adela Stan","County":"București","Director":"Ernest Oberländer-Târnoveanu","E-mail address":["direct@mnir.ro","edpr@mnir.ro","pr@mnir.ro"],"Fax":["021.311.33.56"],"Founded":"1970","General profile":"History","Historic Monument Building":"B-II-m-A-19843","Importance":"National","Locality":"București","Main profile":"Roman Archaeology, History, Numismatics","Museum code":"7300100","Name":"National History Museum of Romania","Phone":["021.315.82.07","021.315.70.56"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7300100_12.jpg"],"Position":"Șef Department","Postal code":"030026","Social media":["https://www.facebook.com/MNIRpage/?fref\u003dts"],"Time table":["Wednesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 18:00 (summer)","9:00 - 17:00 (winter)","Monday, Tuesday: closed"],"Virtual tour":["http://www.muzeulvirtual.ro"],"Website":["http://www.mnir.ro"]},{"Address":"Strada Vasile Pârvan nr. 12, sector 1","Administrative subordination":"Private Museum/Collection","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d20\u0026-Colectia-Memoriala-„Maria-Filotti”-Bucuresti","Collection(s)":"The lodgings of actress Maria Filotti (1883 - 1956) opened to the public in 1965, and have preserved the atmosphere from the time when the artist lived, depicting moments and great stage performances of Maria Filotti, from her debut in Jassy to her death in Bucharest.

The Castle: On the old mansion bought by Octavian Goga from Berta Boncza, widow of the poet Endre Ady - a building with one level and modest size with the facade openings with gothic arches and an embattled tower in the old tradition of Gothic provincial architecture of the Austro-Hungarian Empire - between 1921 and 1926 Octavian Goga builds a new building, retaining wall and foundation of the old part, extending its surface and by adding another level, with large windows and semi-circular arches on the ground floor, with the right heightened profile of a tower - reminiscent of Italian campanile. The building had a reception hall board by five semi-circular openings imagining an outdoor loggia, dining room and several domestic destinations and upstairs - the music room, library, office work of the poet, on one side, and on the other bedrooms and the bathroom. The first of the two rooms of the museum is the library comprising about 6,000 books, as well as a Moor cedar wood chestboard (the 16th century), a desk, a sofa, and a few chairs.

The main occupations of the inhabitants were subsistence agriculture, cattle rearing, work in the woods, and beekeeping. Houses generally had a living room and a pantry, each with separate entrances from the porch. The living room, called \"casa\" (home) was simply arranged, using the entire space. The bed was made of wood and has two side legs being directly trapped between the wall beams. It was covered with a sheep wool wrapped rug with motifs consisting of simple black and white parallel lines. Table and benches were made of wood, simple storage with different themes. The house was not decorated with fabrics as in the lowlands and their models were simpler, however, the walls were covered with glass icons. The costume is simple and practical. Women covered with long “proboadă”, homespun striped in loose cotton ends, then, in time, this piece is replaced with a cloth the size of a handkerchief decorated with stitching ends. A particular interest is the long shirt and lapel fitted with twisted hemp, over which wear the breastplate. The girl wearing black silk apron embroidered with floral ornaments and apron (“zadie”) back with colored lines. Man clothes manly consist of: large shirt with stitches placed one in front and one in back, trousers and bolero with archaic cut, simple white long coat (“’țundra”), wool stockings and sandals. A sector includes tools with which material (hemp and wool) was processed and converted into yarn: “melița” for crushing strains of hemp fibers, “hecelele” for separate waste wood bundle, cleaning combs for wool, wool combs for teasel, and hamp and wool distaff, and a waving loom.","Commune":"Râmeț","Contact person":"Alba Victoria","County":"Alba","Founded":"2006","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Brădet","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"7111770","Name":"Brădet ethnographic exhibition","Part of":"National Museum of Unificaton","Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111770_11.jpg"],"Postal code":"517590","Time table":["On demand"]},{"Access":"near the Town Hall","Address":"Strada Principală nr. 6","Administrative subordination":"Alba County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1900\u0026-Expozitia-etnografica-Ocolis-Ocolis-Alba","Collection(s)":"Documented in the year 1408 under the name Aklos, Ocolis is famous for its folk garb and ancient customs.

Different objects were placed on top of these: wooden pails with water, earthen mugs, bowls, wooden spoons; icons and decorative scarves hung from the wall. The oil lamp hung from the cross beam and was lit in the evening; at night a rushlight was used in case one had to go into the yard. The floors were protected with woven cloth. Wooden vessels were used to make bread and process milk. The dough and bread were made using a pan, a small wooden trough and a wooden shovel. The processing of milk used a pail, a trough, a large spoon, some rope and a wheelbarrow for transportation. The smaller pail was used to transport water and the cutting board held the cornbread which was cut with a long piece of thread attached to the board. The objects used for hemp processing (crusher, combs, reed, carder, reel, spindle) and wool processing (combs, distaffs, etc.) are well represented.

The first category includes carpets, cushions, wall sheets, tablecloths, bedding. Predominantly yellow shapes of geometric (diamonds, squares, hexagons, circles, lines), floral (poppies, tulips, roses, sprigs), cosmic (moon, stars) or animal (ram\u0027s horns, birds) nature blend harmoniously pursuant to the principles of the decorative art (repetition, alternation, symmetry) over a mainly green or brown background. The cloth can have a plain weave (beaten), a twill weave or a sateen weave depending on which technique is used. The most demanding and painstakingly difficult technique is the sateen weave. Through this technique one makes patterns after choosing the types of yarn and the colors of the fiber according to a given pattern. Another category of textiles is used for clothing: shirts, aprons, skirts, petticoats, undershirts, trousers, keeping with the specific of local costumes - black skirts with different color stitching and shirts with darting. The interior consisted of a hallway and the house proper, the former being used more in the summertime. Here we find the hearth where the oven for baking bread is set and it occupies almost half the room. The smoke went straight up to the attic because the room had no ceiling. Within the house the traditional bed occupies most of the room, both in length and in height, with a long seat set along its side. A long dresser made with the same technique as the seat and a table were also placed in this room. On the walls we find plates, icons and to a lesser extent photographs; there was a mirror or a large icon adorned with embroidered towels between the windows. Hanging from the crossbeam we have decorative scarves and clay cups and plates.","Commune":"Roșia de Secaș","Contact person":"Bogdan Felicia","County":"Alba","E-mail address":["feliciabogdan133@yahoo.com"],"Founded":"2006","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Roșia de Secaș","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"7111630","Name":"Roșia Montană ethnographic exhibition","Part of":"National Museum of Unificaton","Phone":["0258.765.705","0766.707.391","0733.914.873"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7111630_12.jpg"],"Postal code":"517640","Time table":["On demand"],"Website":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografica-rosia-de-secas/"]},{"Access":"in the Kindergarden","Address":"Strada Principală","Administrative subordination":"Alba County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1902\u0026-Expozitia-etnografica-Leorint-Leorint-Alba","Collection(s)":"The exhibition tries to restore a traditional farmhouse.

There are three galleries: the Bear Gallery, Emil Racoviță Gallery, and Candle Gallery, as well as four halls: Candle Hall, Spaghetti Hall, Emil Racoviță hall and Bone Hall. There are also many fossil remains of the cave bear - Ursus Spelaeus - extinct about 15,000 years ago.","Commune":"Pietroasa","County":"Bihor","Founded":"1980","General profile":"Natural Sciences","Importance":"County","Locality":"Chișcău","Main profile":"Natural Sciences - Caves","Museum code":"7108300","Name":"Bears\u0027 Cave","Phone":["0359.411.083","0744.638.244"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7108300_01.jpg"],"Postal code":"417366","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00"],"Website":["http://www.pesteraursilor.ro/"]},{"Access":"Main Street","Address":"Strada Principală nr. 92","Administrative subordination":"Bistrița-Năsăud County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1776\u0026-Muzeul-Literar-si-Memorial-„Teodor-Tanco”-Monor-Bistrita-Nasaud","Collection(s)":"The collection includes the working room of the writer Teodor Tanco with its original items as well as a library with works of local writers from Bistrița area.","Commune":"Monor","Contact person":"Titieni Ioan","County":"Bistrița-Năsăud","Director":"Gavrilaș Vasilichi George Alexandru","Founded":"2007","General profile":"Memorials","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Monor","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"7108100","Name":"\"Teodor Tanco\" Literary and Memorial Museum","Part of":"Bistrița-Năsăud Museum Complex","Phone":["0763.697.883"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7108100_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7108100_02.jpg"],"Postal code":"427175","Time table":["Wednesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 17:00 (October to March), 10:00 - 18:00 (Aprilie to September)","Monday and Tuesday closed"],"Virtual tour":["http://www.360x.ro/muzeu-bn/monor/"],"Website":["http://complexulmuzealbn.ro/ro/sectii/muzeul-literar-teodor-tanco-monor"]},{"Address":"Strada Principală nr. 1343","Administrative subordination":"Local Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1740\u0026-Colectia-de-etnografie-„Gheorghe-Grigore-Caitar”-Oituz-Bacau","Collection(s)":"Collection of textiles for home decoration, folk costumes, embroidery, stock, stock kitchenware, traditional agricultural tools, coins, medals, photos and documents.","Commune":"Oituz","Contact person":"Constanța Ghioldum","County":"Bacău","Founded":"2003","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Oituz","Main profile":"Ethnogaphy","Museum code":"7107300","Name":"\"Gheorghe Grigore Caităr\" Ethnographic Collection","Phone":["0234.337.550"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7107300_14.jpg"],"Position":"Custode","Postal code":"607365","Time table":["10:00 - 14:00"]},{"Access":"in the proximity of the railways station","Address":"Strada Principală nr.160","Administrative subordination":"Local Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1739\u0026-Colectia-de-etnografie-„Antal-Maria”-Ghimes-Bacau","Collection(s)":"The building was built in 1800, is a former Hebrew house and a former butcher.

Conacul Goleștilor, construit în 1640, este monument istoric și a fost restaurat în perioada 1942 - 1943. În Conacul Goleștilor sunt expuse obiecte de istorie memorială: mobilier de epocă, obiecte personale ale familiei Golescu, manuscrise, artă decorativă, carte. Secția în aer liber cuprinde arhitectură și tehnică populară, instalații viticole și pomicole. Muzeul pomiculturii și viticulturii este organizat pe trei sectoare complementare. Cel mai important sector este cel al gospodăriilor țărănești aduse din principalele zone viticole și pomicole ale țării, grupate sub forma unui sat românesc, care urmează conturul țării, și înlănțuirea provinciilor istorice naționale. Fiecare gospodărie viticolă sau pomicolă înglobează în cadrul ei, atât casa de locuit, cât și toate dependințele aferente și uneltele de lucru specifice. Al doilea sector este constituit din instalațiile și instrumentarul specific ocupațiilor principale care se află în afara gospodăriilor, cum sunt: cramele, conacele de deal, povernele etc. Sectorul al treilea se va constitui în cadrul unui pavilion construit special, care va înfățișa istoria pomiculturii și viticulturii din România, din cele mai vechi timpuri până în prezent, pe baza dovezilor arheologice, numismatice, epigrafice, documentelor istorice etc. Până în prezent au fost amenajate 30 de gospodării complexe viticole și pomicole, cuprinzând fiecare între 3 și 7 construcții anexe, precum și un număr de 14 construcții din sectorul de instalații din afara gospodăriilor, care împreună cu casele și celelalte construcții, depășesc cifra de 140 de obiective. Cele mai numeroase construcții aflate în muzeul pomi-viticol în aer liber datează din secolele al XVIII-lea și al XIX-lea.","Commune":"Ștefănești","Contact person":"Iustin Dejanu","County":"Argeș","Director":"Iustin Dejanu","E-mail address":["cmngolesti@yahoo.com"],"Fax":["0248.265.148"],"Founded":"1939","General profile":"Ethnography","Historic Monument Building":"AG-II-m-A-13697.01","Importance":"National","Locality":"Golești","Main profile":"Ethnography, History","Museum code":"7104800","Name":"Wine Growing and Tree Growing Museum","Phone":["0248.266.364","0737.508.672"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7104800_13.jpg"],"Position":"Director","Postal code":"117717","Social media":["https://www.facebook.com/muzeul.golesti"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1731\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Vladimir-Streinu”-Teiu-Vale-Arges","Museum code":"6979800","Name":"\"Vladimir Streinu\" Memorial House"}],"Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00 (summer)","9:00 - 16:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"],"Virtual tour":["https://muzeedelasat.ro/muzee/muzeul-viticulturii-si-pomiculturii-golesti/"],"Website":["http://www.muzeulgolesti.ro"]},{"Access":"1.5km from Râșnov, on the road Valea Cetății towards Poiana Brașov","Administrative subordination":"SC EMS Cave SRL","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1941\u0026-Pestera-„Valea-Cetatii”-Rasnov-Brasov","Collection(s)":"Cave Valley Cetății (Valley of the Citadel) was declared a protected natural area of national value and natural monument.

The interior offers excellent conditions for visitation. The fauna characteristic of such carstic forms proves to be scarce, as until now no cave species were found. Instead, the fossil remains of the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) were found. Locals had known it before 1579, the year when Dâmbovicioara was documented, during the time of Mihnea Turcitul. Later, in 1767, J.

The characteristic furniture consists of a daybed made of wood; a bed with a wooden frame, with two headboards, covered by a mattress filled with fresh straw at every harvest; a high or rectangular table with four straight or crossed legs or “feet”; “lodve” - rudimentary chairs without backs; a wooden dowry chest which is usually the most beautiful object within the house, with simple geometric ornamentation, containing a girl’s dowry and also standing testament to her diligence. The room was adorned with different handmade woven fabrics: scarves, towels, tablecloths and pillowcases. The walls were decorated with different shaped and colored plates and bowls and glass painted icons framed by woven towels decorated with the characteristic floral or geometric motifs. Artistically crafted pots and containers hung from the rafters while wares meant for daily use were placed on a sideboard. Weaving was one of the most representative household occupations in the life of a country woman and it was an almost constant concern for young girls and married women, partly due to necessity but also because it was a means of obtaining a good reputation within the community.

Here we also find the table, the bench and the chest of drawers used especially for storing woven items and the young girl’s dowry. Glass painted icons are placed on the walls and loom woven mats are placed on the floor, over the packed earth. A special item, rarely encountered in other exhibitions, is the solid wood credenza, usually considered city furniture that complements the interior of this guest room. In the hallway we find a variety of rustic weavings, carpets, undershirts, Romanian and Saxon folk costumes, ornamental napkins - meant to create a pleasant environment - woven from various vegetable fibers: flax, hemp, cotton and wool. All these were produced within the household and the exhibition includes items such as: loom, distaff, spindle and shuttle. A corner of the exhibition is reserved for the Golden Age, with a wall displaying photos of members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, led by Nicolae Ceausescu, and this segment includes a collection of newspapers from that era. All these artistic creations mark aspects from the life and history of the region, with an important contribution made by craftsmen who, through their exquisite skill, transformed the line, decoration and chromatics into a perfect artistic blend, using factory and homemade materials. The old names for the village were Kakova, Olah Szaszs, Vlad Haza or Vladhaza. Documentary attestation came late in 1733, but it is not consistent with the age of this village. The „Adormirea Maicii Domnului” church - an important historical monument for the area - still lies within the village and it was mentioned in Transylvanian statistics as being built in the early seventeenth century. An ethnographic exhibition was opened in two rooms in order to highlight the cultural heritage of the area, trying to provide as much detail regarding aspects of yesteryear traditional life. The interior of the rustic house is fairly plain. The house has a single room where all the activities took place and it has a fixed structure comprising: table, daybed, chest, sideboard, dowry chest, and loom. The daybed was customary in farmhouses and it sat next to the wall in front of the table. It was used as a bench for sitting at the table and in the evening it could be used as a bed. Interior woven fabrics were made of: hemp, hemp and cotton, hemp and wool. The towels, bedding, pillowcases, cloth bags, napkins, saddlebags and mattresses were homemade only. Traditional garb bears the imprint of the mountainfolk and the Lunca Mureșului area, since the town lies at the confluence of these two ethnographic areas.

Fiber spinning and weaving as well as clothing manufacturing are domestic occupations requiring suitable working tools. Thus, starting from spinning the fibers, which had the dual purpose of stretching and twisting the fibers with spindle and distaff, spinning wheel, and turning them into yarn, then winding them using winders, continuing with weaving them on horizontal looms where fabrics were obtained, the industry ended up providing a wide range of finished products. The rustic interior creates a complex image of household functionality and aesthetics of the traditional village. The bed with straw mattress and cotton bedding with white lace edges over which the thick checkered woolen carpet was placed also holds the beautifully decorated pillows at one end; the older artifacts have few predominant colors - red and black -, while the newer ones have a more colorful, complex and richer design. A special place in the exhibition is reserved for ceramics, represented by predominantly dark green glazed vessels (glazed both inside and out).

The apron, consisting of two woolen sheets, was woven on the loom; the skirt was also woven but had a single sheet and was hemmed with lace.

The exhibition depicts a cottage with the entrance in the middle of the hallway, with a room on either side of it. Here we find the hearth and the bread oven. The horn for the oven was wide, crossing the roof, serving as a smokehouse as well. The house walls and the ceilings of the living quarters were made of wooden beams and unshaped stakes. The traditional folk costume of Cut, through its appearance, lines, decoration and color is representative of the entire area of the Secas valley, resembling the so-called \"Săliște suit.\" The woman\u0027s costume consists of the following parts: undershirt, petticoats (“poale”), vest, ornate skirts, apron and as headgear the “chișchinău” - a headscarf of varying color according to age. Slippers or boots were worn on the feet. The long winter overcoat, reaching over the knee, completed the costume. A white kerchief wrapped around the head, also called a “propoada” , was customary for a woman’s costume. Girls covered their heads with black scarves, with red feathers and green slippers. In winter they wore long woolen knee socks (cioci). The man\u0027s costume consists of the following main parts: knee-length shirt, made of hemp, flax or cotton; instead of pants, they wore woolen or linen tapered trousers toped with a black leather girdle; lambskin vest worn over the shirt, or overcoat made of black cloth. In addition to folk garb, women wove carpets on the loom. The needlepoint or woven finery is a thing of beauty. The wool rugs are different from the carpets because they lack the decoration. Tablecloths are woven together with the carpets and they differ only in size since the cloth and the decoration is the same. Pieces of hemp and cotton cloth are woven with two or more threads over a white background. The earthen mugs and large cups are shorter, with a taller neck, fitted with a spout for draining the liquid. Pitchers, also known as cups, alternating between a spherical and oval profile, have a very narrow neck, a small rim and a single round handle which communicates with the bottom through a channel.","Commune":"Cut","Contact person":"Pr.

The movable and intangible heritage of the area which was recovered from the villagers was exhibited in a thematically structured ethnographic collection. Arranged in three rooms, the exhibition reconstructs the interior of a cottage as well as specific activities such as weaving and viticulture. As shown in the traditional home decor, a special place is held by the female traditional costume with two skirts, undershirt and petticoats. Made at first from homemade fabric, this type of garb has undergone some changes during its evolution because commercially purchased cloth was increasingly used (jolj, silk, cotton cloth), which in turn changed the decorative style of the costume. The male costume consisted of a long shirt with ornate collar worn over trousers, usually with a broad leather girdle, decorated with different motifs made by stamping. Summer pants were made of white cloth and the winter pants, or trousers, from white or gray rough homespun. For cold weather, both men and women wore sheepskin vests and rough homespun overcoats. In the living room there were one or two beds, one to the left and one to right, the table between the two windows, and one to three benches, one next to the wall facing the street and the others next to the other walls. The one next to the wall facing the street was fixed and the others movable, so that they could be brought to the table when serving food. Chairs were scarce, only two or three. The benches were replaced with daybeds where clothes were stored. Under the crossbeam there were pegs from which ornamental wares hung. Behind the door was the sideboard which held the potter; glass painted icons and family photos were on display on the walls. Weaving was a more laborious task, requiring several prior operations: setting up the warp, mounting the warp and setting up the weft. Setting up the warp usually took place within a larger space in the courtyard beside a fence. Mounting the warp consisted of putting the warp yarns on the back roll of the loom, held taut with rods between them as not to get tangled. Mounting the weft was a complicated operation and it took place in the house. Depending on the type of fabric and the technique used for it the warp threads and the weft threads were properly placed. If a lot of viticulture tools can be found in an agricultural inventory, such as hoes, spades, picks and even to a lesser extent plows and saws, there are certain objects, such as the vine knife -best known as the sickle -, as well as some wooden vessels for grape picking, wine pressing and storing, which are related specifically to viticulture.","Commune":"Cricău","Contact person":"Blagu Ionela","County":"Alba","E-mail address":["ionelablagu@yahoo.com"],"Founded":"2007","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Cricău","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"7101580","Name":"Cricău ethnographic exhibition","Part of":"National Museum of Unificaton","Phone":["0258.845.105","0727.354.235"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101580_11.jpg"],"Postal code":"517265","Time table":["On demand"],"Website":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografica-cricau/"]},{"Access":"in the Kindergarden","Address":"Strada Principală nr. 69","Administrative subordination":"Alba County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1886\u0026-Expozitia-Etnografica-Ciuruleasa-Ciuruleasa-Alba","Collection(s)":"The space allotted to the exhibition was arranged so that the mere sight of it should bring back the bygone magic of this village, as the locals remember it.

These were all produced by this household. Here one encounters the richest collection of folk costumes in the county (23 in total). A distinct element of this exhibition is the presence of women’s winter costumes specific to this area and these reflect a massive influence of city garb elements seamlessly integrated into the traditional costumes. Important moments of village life and especially the life of local people are captured in old photos. The hallway is the room housing the loom and all the objects necessary for homemade textiles: distaffs, pulleys, reels, shuttles, spindles. Here we find on display fabrics produced through the toil of long winter nights when the storytelling took place. Items made through this craft were used to make clothing, scarves, towels, tablecloths, carpets, rugs, bags. In traditional homes the clothes and other fabrics used in everyday life were hung on a horizontal pole suspended from the ceiling beam. The influence of the Hungarian ethnicity is present throughout the exhibition by means of traditional garb belonging to the two ethnic communities, Romanian and Hungarian. The pantry is the place where cooking utensils for everyday use are kept: pots, plates, mugs. Among the simple earthenware we find a few fine china objects, such as an “untieai\" (receptacle for holding butter), which presumably belonged to a noble family from the area. The “boacaz” is the annex where we find the clay bread oven and where the flour was sifted, the dough was kneaded and the bread was baked; the patellas lean against the mouth of the oven and next to them we find the sifting sieve, the kneading trough and the flour chest. Next to this we find the tool shed and the barn which attest to the traditional occupations, with displays related to activities such as agriculture (truss, plow), gathering and viticulture (implements for vine picking), wine preparation and storing (muzzle, barrel and gourd).","Commune":"Cetatea de Baltă","Contact person":"Cucui Maria","County":"Alba","Founded":"2006","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Cetatea de Baltă","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"7101560","Name":"Cetatea de Baltă ethnographic exhibition","Part of":"National Museum of Unificaton","Phone":["0258.886.101","0258.886.364"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101560_12.jpg"],"Postal code":"517235","Time table":["On demand"]},{"Access":"near the Town Hall","Address":"Strada Principală nr.14","Administrative subordination":"Alba County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1884\u0026-Expozitia-Etnografica-Ceru-Bacainti-Ceru-Bacainti-Alba","Collection(s)":"What attracts the visitor and has special value in terms of the character of this place is the house itself wherein lies the ethnographic exhibition. The 110 years old house was constructed with a stone masonry technique that uses stone slabs interwoven with clay and sand. The stone slabs are rigorously sorted by thickness and they are almost perfectly aligned in rows. The customary porch is built only along the larger side of the living room. The porch entrance lies on the shorter side with the entrance to the small hallway on the opposite side. This system allows for better temperature management inside the house during the winter months. Access to the house proper is gained through the hallway, where old wooden beams used to be but they were covered because of decay. The house used to be covered with straw placed on hardwood rafters, called prongs, but nowadays it is covered with ceramic tile. The interior finish of the walls is made of what is known in the area as “muruialǎ” (a type of clay based stucco) over which whitewash was applied.","Commune":"Ceru Băcăinți","Contact person":"Bătrâna Andreea","County":"Alba","Founded":"2006","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Ceru Băcăinți","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"7101550","Name":"Ceru Băcăinți ethnographic exhibition","Part of":"National Museum of Unificaton","Phone":["0258.720.222"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101550_10.jpg"],"Postal code":"517220","Time table":["On demand"],"Website":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografic%c7%8e-ceru-b%c7%8ec%c7%8einti/"]},{"Access":"Communal Library, in the village centre","Address":"Strada Principală nr. 250","Administrative subordination":"Alba County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1883\u0026-Expozitia-etnografica-Cenade-Cenade-Alba","Collection(s)":"At Cenade, as well as in other places in the county, the ethnographic exhibition communicates directly with the communal library, practically sharing the same space. The exhibition presents popular creations from this region resulting from weaving, needlepoint, woodcarving and other crafts. A traditional interior corner is recreated within the display, including a bed with hemp, cotton and wool covers and pillow cases. A perennial piece for such an interior is the loom. In conjunction with it there are some tools and components used in the homemade textile industry: sley, shuttle, shuttle box, picker, reed, warp beam, wool combs, distaffs, spindles, etc. These homemade pieces are simple, without ornamentation. The furniture is also simple, unadorned, but its simplicity is complimented by the beauty of the bedding and tablecloths woven by the village women. These pieces were adorned with fine cloth decorated with great skill by local women with a good eye for color coordination. Besides towels, glass painted icons, plates, jugs, earthenware, antique irons, mortars and pestles, lamps, we can also mention a chest, a crib, a wedding flag, the steward’s canteen and wooden clubs for announcers, these latter objects pertaining to the traditional wedding custom. A major part of these traditional creations is the folk costume and this is proven by the large amount of clothing pieces on display, some of which were lovingly donated to set up this collection. Since Saxons also lived in these parts the pieces on display belong to both ethnic groups. Nowadays folk costumes are worn for special events and celebrations.","Commune":"Cenade","Contact person":"Fleșeru Gabriela","County":"Alba","Founded":"2006","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Cenade","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"7101540","Name":"Cenade ethnographic exhibition","Part of":"National Museum of Unificaton","Phone":["0258.789.104","0760.237.887"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101540_12.jpg"],"Postal code":"517210","Time table":["On demand"],"Website":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitia-etnografic%c7%8e-cenade/"]},{"Access":"village centre, in the school building","Address":"Strada Principală","Administrative subordination":"Alba County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1882\u0026-Expozitia-etnografica-Bucium-Sasa-Bucium-Sasa-Alba","Collection(s)":"Several artists have worked in this village, such as folklorist Ion Pop Reteganul, who printed the Foișoara magazine, and writer Ion Agârbiceanu, who depicted realistically in novels the harsh rural life - especially in the novel “Archangels”. The Bucium ethnographic exhibition brings attention to these local peculiarities. Bucium was an important trade center for furriers (beautifully decorated coats and vests), carpenters and folk costume manufacturers. Given the needs and possibilities of the locals, the manufacture of certain pieces of clothing and footwear became a specialized trade. Male garb consists of: shirt with large front and back gussets, trousers and vest with an old-fashioned cut, simple vest, white coat, protective woolen footwear and shoes. Female garb consists of: shirt and skirt, front and back apron, tricolor belt, two overlapping singlets and jacket. The head is covered with a scarf. In addition to these, rich ornaments made of gold and silver are also customary. Another feature that is worth noting is the type of singlet worn by the Bucium women, one short and very close to the body and one longer and wider, with side godets, worn on top of the first, both decorated with fine embroidery of black cotton and gold thread. The crafts from this area coincide with crafts from other areas, such as textile processing, but here, thanks to the area’s specific, people had other occupations as well, such as furring and goldsmithing.","Commune":"Bucium","Contact person":"Duna Liliana","County":"Alba","E-mail address":["liliana.duna@yahoo.com"],"Founded":"2006","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Bucium Șasa","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"7101530","Name":"Bucium Șasa ethnographic exhibition","Part of":"National Museum of Unificaton","Phone":["0731.366.449","0729.161.937"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7101530_12.jpg"],"Postal code":"517165","Time table":["On demand"],"Website":["http://www.cjalba.ro/expozitie-etnografica-bucium-sasa/"]},{"Access":"village centre, in the courtyard of the Orthodox Church","Address":"Strada Principală nr. 77","Administrative subordination":"Alba County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1881\u0026-Muzeul-Etnografic-si-Religios-Bucerdea-Vinoasa-Bucerdea-Vinoasa-Alba","Collection(s)":"The private museum of Bucerdea Vinoasa occupies an important place among local attractions; it’s a museum with an ethnographic and religious display housed by the best space for this purpose - the Orthodox churchyard within the village center. The community’s cultural heritage was organized thematically as follows: local history, ethnography and church history. The largest space is devoted to the ethnographic side of the museum: a rural cottage interior; storytelling customs; the presence of wheat in traditions, customs and the sacred space; traditional viticulture; photography as an ethnographic document. Both the objects and their placement in the room show how the interior of a cottage- a two room mud brick structure covered with straw - was organized in the nineteenth century: the entrance hall and the house proper(living room) with a back porch. Including everything from traditional furniture to fabrics and folk garb, the display is enriched by the reenactment of the traditional custom of storytelling. Old photographs complete the ethnographic overview of this settlement with moments from the popular calendar, important events from everyday life, along with those showing the evolution of traditional garb over time. An attempt was made throughout the exhibit to provide a unified picture of an ancient occupation, agriculture, with a focus on plants that are at the heart of many stages of human life: wheat and vines. An important part of the display is dedicated to traditional viticulture. The display depicts the process the grapes go through from the vine all the way to the finished product, accentuating the distinctive pieces related to vineyard work such as the stone winepress from the second half of the eighteenth century. The wheat grain also has a special place due to the history and importance of cereal cultivation as well as its inclusion in Romanian folk habits, beliefs and practices regarding the human life cycle, yearly events and the sacred space. Two separate areas are reserved for local history. One space is devoted to some archaeological evidence from one of the most important Dacian fortresses from Alba county, APOULON (PIATRA CRAIVII), highlighting the triple role of the old fortress: military, civic and spiritual center. The other area highlights the religious history of this community drawing the visitor’s attention to fragments of frescoes and eighteenth century iconostases, old books and a religious painted glass icon from the Maierii Bălgrad art center.","Commune":"Ighiu","Contact person":"Pr.

By 1952, his collection numbered more than 2,300 objects. The same year the collection became a public museum named Lupșa Ethnographic Museum. The deciding contribution came from the then manager of the Transylvania Ethnographic Museum in Cluj, Valeriu Butura, who provided the auxiliary means for exhibiting and preserving the heritage. Teacher Albu further enriched the collections, gathering more than 8,107 museum objects, many of them of national cultural heritage value.

Damaged by fires, destroyed by earthquakes, left in ruin following the Austro-Russo-Turkish war from 1768 - 1774, this princely residence was no longer inhabitable. Thus, Alexander Ipsilanti had to build a new princely court in Dealul Spirii - the New Court, in 1775. After it was built, the buildings of the old court, found in ruin, became known under the name of the Old Court. Lately the archaeologists had uncovered many evidence on the Old Court. The edifice bears the seal of the reigns of Grigore Ghica, Șerban Cantacuzino, and Constantin Brâncovan. Its beautiful portal dates to the time of Prince Ștefan Cantacuzino.

Lipsa patrimoniului a făcut ca instituția să nu ființeze de sine stătător imediat după luarea hotărârii, primăria organizând, prin Direcția culturală, strângerea colecțiilor și căutarea unui sediu. Activitatea se intensifică după 1926. Donația lui D. A. Rosetti din iulie 1929 a constituit nucleul de bază al secției preistorice. În luna următoare muzeului i-a fost atribuit un spațiu în imobilul din Calea Moșilor 115, unde s-a organizat o expoziție cu materiale arheologice rezultate din săpături. În februarie 1930 muzeul primește Casa Moruzi, monument istoric, situată în Calea Victoriei 117, iar în 22 noiembrie 1931 este inaugurată expoziția muzeului. Dr. George Severeanu a fost timp de peste 8 ani director al Muzeului Municipal, sub îndrumarea lui muzeul cunoscând o remarcabilă dezvoltare. S-au înființat secții noi: numismatică, medalistică, documente, istoria breslelor, urbanistică, s-a dezvoltat secțiunea artistică. În iulie 1933 a luat ființă, pe lângă muzeu, Pinacoteca municipiului, adăpostită în casa amiralului Vasile Urseanu, din Bd. Lascăr Catargiu. Muzeul s-a preocupat de înregistrarea pe peliculă a caselor vechi, fiind deținătorul unei valoaroase colecții de fotografii. Patrimoniul muzeal a crescut prin cercetări de teren, donații și achiziții. În martie 1941, după mai multe peregrinări, muzeului i se atribuie casa Cesianu, din Calea Victoriei 151, unde a fost adus întregul patrimoniu. Consecințele războiului au fost resimțite din plin de muzeu, casa Cesianu fiind rechiziționată pentru spital, iar colecțiile împachetate și strânse în câteva camere. Piesele cele mai valoroase ale muzeului au fost evacuate, în 1944, în comuna Rasnic-Dolj, unde au rămas, parte din ele, până în octombrie 1948. După ce în 1948 muzeul va fi mutat temporar în localul Muzeului de Artă Națională din Șoseaua Kiseleff nr. 3, în 10 decembrie 1956 muzeului îi este atribuit Palatul Șuțu, iar pe 23 ianuarie 1959 are loc redeschiderea pentru public a Muzeului de Istorie a orașului București. Palatul Șuțu este monument istoric, datând din 1834, operă a arhitecților Johann Veit și Conrad Schwink, care au ridicat un palat în stil neogotic, cu patru turnulețe poligonale și cupolă, pe ruinele unor construcții mai vechi. Holul central a fost finisat în 1862 de artistul Karl Storck, care a deschis trei arcade, scara monumentală cu două brațe și a montat o uriașă oglindă de Murano pe peretele din față. După moartea primului proprietar, Costache Grigore Șuțu, palatul rămâne în posesia fiului acestuia, Grigore Șuțu (1819 - 1893). Clădirea a avut diferite destinații publice în prima jumătate a acestui secol. A fost restaurată între anii 1957 - 1958, redându-i-se în bună parte înfățișarea inițială. Colecția de arheologie cuprinde piese începând din paleolitic, neolitic, epoca bronzului (culturile Glina III și Tei), geto-dacice de la Fundeni, Snagov, Popești-Novaci, dealul Piscului. Cea mai mare parte a colecției datează din perioada medievală: vase ceramice, podoabe, tezaure monetare etc. Colecția de numismatică, medalistică și sigilografie: tezaure monetare otomane, austriece, rusești, sigilii evocând marile familii boierești Năsturel-Herescu, Lenș, Ghica, Balș, Paladi, medalii, plachete, insigne și decorații. Colecția de fotografii: peste 49.000 de fotografii, clișee pe sticlă, filme, incluzând primele imagini fotografice ale orașului București, executate în 1856 de Angerer, aspecte de la cercetările arheologice, lucrările de sistematizare ale orașului, clădiri, aspecte din viața orașului. Colecția de documente: hrisoave, cele mai vechi datând din 1488 - 1582, fondul Manuc (în limba armeană cu caractere turcești), documente medievale, moderne și contemporane. Colecția de hărți și planuri, cu aproape 1.000 de piese privitoare la istoria orașului București, la Peninsula Balcanică, cursul Dunării, precum și la unele moșii ale boierilor. Colecția de artă plastică este alcătuită din tablouri, desene, pietre funerare, steme. Colecția de stampe, gravuri și litografii conține imagini de localități din țară și de peste hotare, personalități, tipuri sociale, scene de luptă, târguri etc. Colecția de mobilier istoric și obiecte de uz casnic, colecția de arme, uniforme, steaguri, colecția de costume și obiecte textile (piese de îmbrăcăminte, eșantioane de țesături datând din secolele XVI - XIX, podoabe, covoare, perne, perdele, brâie, unele descoperite în cursul săpăturilor arheologice), colecția de obiecte de cult (icoane, tripticuri, cruci din secolele XVII - XIX), precum și o bibliotecă cu peste 45.000 de exemplare, din care aproape în întregime literatură privitoare la București.","County":"București","Director":"Adrian Majuru","E-mail address":["relatiipublice@muzeulbucurestiului.ro"],"Founded":"1921","General profile":"History","Historic Monument Building":"B-II-m-A-18221","Importance":"County","Locality":"București","Main profile":"History","Museum code":"7083500","Name":"Bucharest Municipality Museum","Phone":["021.315.68.58","0722.574.897"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7083500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7083500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7083500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7083500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7083500_05.jpg"],"Postal code":"030167","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2046\u0026-Casa-„Filipescu-Cesianu”-Bucuresti","Museum code":"7083512","Name":"The ”Filipescu-Cesianu” House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1543\u0026-Colectia-de-Arta-„Ligia-si-Pompiliu-Macovei”-Bucuresti","Museum code":"51620000160","Name":"\"Ligia and Pompiliu Macovei\" Fine Art Collection"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d46\u0026-Expozitia-permanenta-Palatul-Voievodal-„Curtea-Veche”-Bucuresti","Museum code":"7083507","Name":"\"The Old Court\" -

By taking part in many oceanic exhibitions, by discovering many fish and crustacean species, the academician Mihai Băcescu gave the museum over 720 exhibits as a gift. All of them are von display in two halls, as a homage paid to the scholar Mihai Băcescu. The museum holds the collection of the biologist and oceanographer Mihai Băcescu (1908 - 1999): dioramas with water flora and fauna, mollusks, fish, corals, crustaceans, gathered in the three oceans, the Black and Mediterranean Seas, the geographical globe with the relief of the terrestrial crust, water birds from Romania, the mollusks and coral collection from the Red Sea donated by C. Căruntu. Two memorial halls are dedicated to the parasitologist veterinary doctor Ioan Ciurea (1879 - 1943), born at Fălticeni, an associate fellow of the Romanian Academy, a university professor in Bucharest, discoverer of new species of parasite worms. In 1984 an aquarium was added. In the 13 pools with a capacity of over 11,000 liters of water, live many species of local and exotic fish, turtles, shells and crabs.

When the gates opened there were only ten animals, currently there are about 500 animals belonging to 120 species, both local and exotic fauna. Currently the garden is divided into five sectors: primates, herbivores, carnivores, the tropical Pavilion, the Lake. The primates’ Pavilion shelters the ten species of monkeys, representing the African primates: baboons with mantle (Papio hamadryas), baboons (Papio cynocephalus), cercophytecus, such as the savannah monkey Cercopythecus aethiops), the hussar monkey (Erytrocebus patas), as well as the magot (Macaca sylvanus). Asia is represented by various species of macaques, such as the common macaque (Macaca fascicularis), the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina)) and the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). At the moment South America is represented by only one species, namely apella (Cebus apella). In the hall there are tropical plants: banana tree, Washingtonia palmer, Phoenix, ficus, and small-sized exotic plants. The herbivore section is on the highest side of the garden and was built by enclosing a natural space. The night shelter of the animals renders the local folk architecture. In the Zoological Garden the carnivores include bears, prey birds and various small mammals belonging to this category of animals. The felines are sheltered in the lions’ Pavilion. Next to the lions’ pavilion, there are the cages for pumas, lynxes and wild cats. There we find the lions, leopards and jaguars. The facilities of the bears, that has functioned since 1986, shelters bears and wolves. This sector includes also prey birds. The tropical pavilion was established in 1983 and is divided into three subsections: the aquarium section, the parrots’ cages and the reptile section. The aquariums are 37 in number and present various fish of the exotic fauna. The amphibians and reptiles sum up about 11,000 species. In the reptile section the order of the crocodiles is represented by the cayman (Caiman crocodiles), that lives in Central and South America. Next to the crocodile pool there is a row of terrariums for constrictor snakes: rhe yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus), the tiger python (python molurus) and boa (Boa constrictor). There is also a collection of smaller snakes: the water snake (Natrix natrix), the cave rat snake (Elaphe taeniura), the common rat snake (Elaphe obsolete), and the common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula). There is another representative of the reptiles: the green iguana (Iguana iguana). In the central part of the building there are the cages of the exotic birds, represented mostly by parrots. We can come across the monk parakeet (Myopsittas monachus), the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), the rosella (Platycercus eximus), the red-rumped parrot (Psephotus haematonotus), and the budgie (Melopsittacus undulates). Opposite the cages of the birds there is a botanic garden with various exotic plants. The lake, artificially built over the years, has become a real biotop. At the moment, besides the waterfowl, there is a diverse fauna.","County":"Mureș","E-mail address":["office@zootirgumures.ro"],"General profile":"Natural Sciences","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Târgu Mureș","Main profile":"Natural Sciences - Zoology","Museum code":"7060700","Name":"Zoological Garden","Phone":["0265.221.408"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7060700_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7060700_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7060700_03.jpg"],"Postal code":"540080","Time table":["09:00 - 19:00, last entry at 18:00 (summer)","10:00 - 17:00, last entry at 16:00 (winter)"],"Website":["http://www.zootirgumures.ro"]},{"Access":"From Târgu Neamt, DN15 B to Neamț Monastery","Administrative subordination":"Local Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1939\u0026-Gradina-zoologica-„Dragos-Voda”-Vanatori-Neamt-Neamt","Collection(s)":"The Zoo is located in the Natural Reserve Neamț.

Thus, the public keen on authentic spiritual values has the opportunity to contemplate an artistic universe evoking inner energies. An experience lived beyond conventions would strongly influence the personality of master Nagy Imre. His reclusion in the privacy of his native village of Jigodin, in the Harghita area, refusing the temptations of urban life, would bring about the experience of a specific way of existence where the picturesque of the place intermingles with social realities. Everything would originally reflect in his vast creation. A perfect master of various techniques (water colours, tempera, oil), Nagy Imre would grasp and immortalize the richness of light and colour in the area of Ciucului depression. An admirable sense of space is revealed in the elements of nature in harmonies animated by lyrical vibrations or in rhythmic cadences oriented towards the vigour of monumentality. More often than not, in the privacy of the natural setting, forever fresh and vital, he brings in human beings comfortably flooded by the ripple of water, the breeze of the wind, the reflections of the vegetation, the calls of cosmic immensity. Nothing grand, nothing cryptic, still everything so profound, close to our soul. Driven by a strong pantheist feeling, he cultivates trust in the positive meaning of life, defining for a creator loving beauty, truth and essence. The portrait definitions of the self - making up a cycle - reveal due to the firmness and the drawing and tension of the colours, the unbinding character, the vigor of the inner nature and the clear-mindedness.","Contact person":"Ioan Șulea","County":"Mureș","Director":"Ötvös Koppány","Founded":"1956","General profile":"Arts","Importance":"County","Locality":"Târgu Mureș","Main profile":"Art","Museum code":"7055502","Name":"\"Nagy Imre\" Art Gallery","Part of":"Mureș County Museum","Phone":["0265.265.267"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055502_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055502_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055502_03.jpg"],"Position":"Șef secție","Postal code":"540057","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"],"Website":["http://muzeumures.ro/"]},{"Access":"Cluj - Târgu Mureș - Deda national road","Address":"Strada Bolyai nr. 17","Administrative subordination":"Mureș County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d443\u0026-Galeria-de-Arta-„Ion-Vlasiu”-Targu-Mures-Mures","Collection(s)":"\"Ion Vlasiu\" gallery, housed on the premises of Teleki Library, was established in 1988 following the donation from master Ion Vlasiu, a Târgu Mureș sculptor, painter and writer. Vlasiu’s triple vocation, known especially as a painter, but being a painter and writer to the same extent, did not lead him to an eclectism of endowments. His paintings sought to find the way into the human soul. He has a nostalgia for the village as cradle of the collective national soul he belongs to and whose survival he strives to ensure in the middle of the contemporary human drama. Following the tradition, he seeks strong colourful brilliance, the vegetative intermingled with a rhythmic decoration bringing about elementary images, stylized appearances and primitive vibrations. The world of the village, the landscape, and history are the main domains he chooses his themes from, under the form of the metaphor, the symbol. The ages of man and the road of his life, the depiction of the paragon figures in everyday anonymous world of the village or in history or national culture are prevailing topics. In his sculptures he seeks to attain those original forms of yore that bring about simple bodies, generated by the forces of nature. No matter what his choice of the material might be - stone, wood, gypsum - he tries to reinvent the pure form. While constantly communicating with his native universe, he gives life to this complex world by laconically engendering children’s heads, old people, peasants, intellectuals or heroes. Due to its morphology and style, his sculptures - especially the totemic depictions as well as the works inspired from fairy tales and legends - are directly linked to the traditions of this people. His novels in which the story of his own life reaches the dimension of literary fiction without losing the thrill of the authenticity of the events he experienced, define his human and artistic self whose primary sources in the village is unquestionable in all its hypostases. In his memoirs, sculptures and paintings, Ion Vlasiu lives the permanent revelation of the world outside and inside himself with an authentic dramatic feeling.","Contact person":"Ioan Șulea","County":"Mureș","Director":"Ötvös Koppány","Founded":"1986","General profile":"Arts","Importance":"County","Locality":"Târgu Mureș","Main profile":"Art","Museum code":"7055501","Name":"\"Ion Vlasiu\" Art Gallery","Part of":"Mureș County Museum","Phone":["0265.267.179"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055501_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055501_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055501_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055501_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055501_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7055501_06.jpg"],"Position":"Șef secție","Postal code":"540067","Time table":["Monday - Friday: 9:00 - 16:00","Saturday: 9:00 - 14:00","Sunday: 9:00 - 13:00"],"Website":["http://muzeumures.ro/"]},{"Access":"Cluj - Târgu Mureș - Toplița, Târgu Mureș - Sighișoara - Brașov national roads.","Accreditation":["O.M.C.I.N. nr. 2699/10.07.2019 Acreditare"],"Address":"Strada Enescu nr. 2","Administrative subordination":"Mureș County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d446\u0026-Muzeul-Judetean-Mures-Muzeul-de-Arta-Targu-Mures-Mures","Collection(s)":"It was established in the Palace of Culture, a historic and art monument, built in a Secession style, between 1912 and 1913.

Parterul Turnului este alcătuit din piatră de râu cu pereți groși de 2,30 m, datează din secolul al XIV-lea. Primele nivele au ferestre mici și goluri de tragere înguste, la nivelul 3 console de zidărie spre Cetate și Orașul de jos, susținând etajele superioare evazate. Există rânduri de guri de tragere \u0026#238;ntre nivele 3 si 4.

The museum was established by Anton Badea due to the desire of conserving and presenting the monuments of architecture, technical installations and folk art artefacts of the area. In 1970 the Reghin Ethnographic Museum became county museum, with the designation of its research area, which exceeds the border of the Mureș county and covers several distinct ethnographic areas (604 rural settlements in the county of Mureș and about 300 localities in neighbouring counties). The exhibits include artefacts relating to crafts, costumes and customs specific of the Upper Valley of Mureș, the Valley of Gurghiu and a part of the Transylvanian Plain. The museum has over 5,800 artefacts, 13,000 photographs and slides, 80 ethnographic movies. Technical installations prevail (oil press, watermill, wine press).

The plan of earlier houses comprises two or three rooms, but by the end of the 18th century emerged more evolved houses with several well partitioned rooms. The walls of the constructions are of wide thick beams ended in the \"blockbau\" system. The roofs are gabled. While earlier houses (16th - 17th centuries) lack verandas, in the 18th centuries almost all had one, made of a sequence of carved decorated pillars forming beautiful archways of a specific pattern. Many constructions have not only an architectural value, but also a documentary one due to their inscriptions. The gates are exceptional pieces in Maramureș. The gates used to be social tokens of the owners. The prevailing pattern on the pillars is the \"life tree\" as a symbol of life without death, solar and star designs, Christian emblems, but also the snake, cock or anthropomorphic figures, all of them marking a long lasting deep faith from immemorial times.","Contact person":"Mara Birta","County":"Maramureș","Director":"Mirela Barz","E-mail address":["muzeulmaramuresului@yahoo.com"],"Founded":"1981","General profile":"Ethnography","Historic Monument Building":"MM-II-a-B-04668","Importance":"Regional","Locality":"Sighetu Marmației","Main profile":"Ethnogaphy","Museum code":"7051501","Name":"Maramureș Village Museum","Part of":"Museum of Maramureș","Phone":["0262.314.229"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_16.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_17.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_18.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051501_19.jpg"],"Position":"Referent - Relații cu publicul","Postal code":"435500","Time table":["Daily: 10:00-18:00 (15 April -30 September) Last entry: 17:30 8:00-16:00 (1 October -14 April) Last entry: 15:30 More information and schedules: 0743151197 - Vasile Nelu Știrb"],"Website":["http://muzeulmaramuresului.ro/"]},{"Access":"DN 18 road","Accreditation":["O.M.C. nr. 2132/11.03.2013","O.M.C.I.N. nr. 2940/20.09.2019 Reacreditare"],"Address":"Piața Libertății nr. 15","Administrative subordination":"Maramureș County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d426\u0026-Muzeul-Maramuresului-Sighetu-Marmatiei-Maramures","Collection(s)":"The museum building, historic monument, was built in 1730, in the Baroque style, and presents the exhibition „Sighetu-Marmației - 680”, opened in Semptember 2006, and a Maramureș fauna and flora collection.","Contact person":"Mara Birta","County":"Maramureș","Director":"Mirela Barz","E-mail address":["muzeulmaramuresului@yahoo.com"],"Fax":["0262.311.521"],"Founded":"1954","General profile":"Ethnography","Historic Monument Building":"MM-II-m-A-04711","Importance":"Regional","Locality":"Sighetu Marmației","Main profile":"Ethnogaphy","Museum code":"7051500","Name":"Museum of Maramureș","Phone":["0262.311.521"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7051500_03.jpg"],"Position":"Referent - Relații cu publicul","Postal code":"435500","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1975\u0026-Sectia-de-Etnografie-Barsana-Muzeul-scolar-Barsana-Maramures","Museum code":"7051506","Name":"Bârsana School Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1976\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Ilie-Lazar”-Giulesti-Maramures","Museum code":"7051507","Name":"Ilie Lazăr Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1974\u0026-Casa-Dunca-Patu-Ieud-Maramures","Museum code":"7051505","Name":"Dunca Pâțu House-Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1508\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Stan-Ion-Patras”-Sapanta-Maramures","Museum code":"51620000133","Name":"\"Stan Ion Pătraș\" Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1507\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Ellie-Wiesel”-Muzeul-Culturii-Evreiesti-din-Maramures-Sighetu-Marmatiei-Maramures","Museum code":"51620000132","Name":"\"Ellie Wiesel\" Memorial House - Museum of Jewish Culture in the Maramureș Region"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1973\u0026-Casa-Muzeu-„Dr.-Ioan-Mihalyi-de-Apsa”,-Galeriile-de-Arta-Sighetu-Marmatiei-Maramures","Museum code":"7051503","Name":"House-Museum “Dr. Ioan Mihalyi de Apșa”, Art Gallery"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1972\u0026-Muzeul-Etnografic-al-Maramuresului-Sighetu-Marmatiei-Maramures","Museum code":"7051502","Name":"Ethnographic Museum of Maramureș"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2089\u0026-Muzeul-Maramuresului-Sectia-de-Istorie-Sighetu-Marmatiei-Maramures","Museum code":"7051508","Name":"Museum of Maramureș.

Iancu de Hunedoara întreprinde lucrări de mare anvergură în două etape între anii 1441-1456, inițial mărind dimensiunile fortificației militare și apoi transformând-o într-un castel somptuos prin lucrări unde predomină stilul gotic. Matei Corvin continuă după anul 1458 lucrările, insistând mai ales pe aspectul de înfrumusețare a construcției existente, astfel pătrunzând influențe renascentiste. Ultima etapă de construcție are loc între anii 1618-1624 când principele Transilvaniei Gabriel Bethlen realizează ultimele construcții de mare anvergură (turnul nou al porții și palatul baroc de pe latura de est - actualmente cu fațadă neogotică). În anul 1724 castelul intră în proprietatea tezaurizatului habsburgic, situație existentă până în 1880. Noua destinație, după anul 1724, produce monumentului daune însemnate, printre care și două incendii, ultimul, cel din 1854 transformându-l într-o ruină, după care este abandonat până în 1868 când începe restaurarea care datează până în 1914. A suportat o nouă etapă de restaurare între anii 1956-1968. După 1997 începe proiectul de punere în valoare a monumentului care este unic în partea răsăriteană a Europei și reprezentativ pentru arhitectura civilă și militară medievală. Muzeul înființat în 1974 cuprindea inițial piese de lapidariu provenite de la lucrările de restaurare efectuate asupra monumentului la sfârșitul secolului al XIX-lea și începutul secolului al XX-lea.

Thus, the most beautiful building in the city, as it is today, becomes the headquarters of a cultural institution, placing the city of Tecuci among the Moldavian cities (Fălciu, Bârlad, Galați, Iași) that could be proud of the existence of a museum. The merit of establishing a museum in Tecuci does not belong only to the philanthropist Teodor Cincu; to the same extent, it also belongs to the two history enthusiasts and collectors: Constantin Solomon and Mihail Dimitriu, whose collections formed the basis of the establishment of the museum to which, later, other heritage objects were added, thus enriching the museum\u0027s heritage. Constantin Solomon was a Romanian language teacher and director of the \"D. A. Sturdza\" from Tecuci, and Mihail Dimitriu was clerk at the Court and then secretary of the Tecuci Bar Association. They, as early as 1924, began to collect various archaeological and paleontological remains from the Tecuci region. The institution has grown constantly, adding year after year, numerous valuable objects from the archaeological research carried out by the museum\u0027s specialists in collaboration with counterparts from prominent institutions in the country. In its warehouses, the museum holds a number of valuable collections in the fields of archaeology, numismatics, medalism, art, modern and contemporary history, documents and photographs, ethnography, pieces of furniture, technique, and a unique piece in Romania (only two models in Europe, one of which is at Tecuci) - EGO 4/14 model car, manufactured in 1924, all of which add up to a number of over 58,250 pieces of heritage. In the archeology collection, the predominant results are the results of the archaeological research carried out in the Poiana site - the Piroboridava settlement, carried out by Prof. Radu Vulpe and Ecaterina Dunăreanu Vulpe starting in 1927 and continued by Prof. Silvia Teodor (Institute of Archeology Iași) and the specialist team of the Tecucean museum until 1990. It is an impressive archaeological heritage that has represented over time the study material for several generations of archaeologists. In this collection we also find representative vestiges for the knowledge of local, zonal and national history contained in extensive areas of some material cultures on the territory of Romania, starting from the Neolithic until the 6th century BC. Thus we mention: the Eneolithic settlement in the village of Toflea, researched by to Marilena Florescu and Mircea Nicu between 1970 and 1974; century biritual necropolis. IV BC from Barcea commune, researched by Mircea Nicu and Stela Țau between 1975 - 1982; the Late Bronze Age settlement in Gârbovăț commune, researched by Radu C. Florescu in 1967; the multi-layered archaeological site (neolithic - modern era) Negrilești - Curtea Scolii, where even today archaeological research is carried out in collaboration with the \"Paul Păltanea\" Galati History Museum.","Contact person":"Daniela Alecsă","County":"Galați","Director":"Daniel Dojan","E-mail address":["muzeultecuci@yahoo.com"],"Fax":["0236.811.672"],"Founded":"1935","General profile":"Archaeology","Historic Monument Building":"GL-II-m-A-03092","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Tecuci","Main profile":"Archaeology","Museum code":"7035400","Name":"\"Teodor Cincu\" History Museum","Phone":["0236.811.672"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_16.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_17.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_18.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_19.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_20.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7035400_21.jpg"],"Position":"Muzeograf","Postal code":"805300","Time table":["Wednesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 18:00 (09:00-17:00 winter)","Monday, Tuesday: closed"],"Website":["https://evmuzealetecuci.wordpress.com"]},{"Access":"17 km N-W of Galați, in a scientific reserve forest, Gârboavele","Address":"Pădurea Gârboavele","Administrative subordination":"Galați County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d315\u0026-Gradina-Zoologica-Galati-Tulucesti-Galati","Collection(s)":"The zoological garden lies 17 km N-W of Galați, in a scientific reserve forest, Gârboavele.

Despre soarta colecției adunate aici în perioada interbelică nu se știu prea multe. În 22 noiembrie 1943 s-a semnat actul de constituire a \"Muzeului orașului și județului Turda\" în prezența profesorilor Constantin Daicoviciu și Ion Berciu. Primăria pune la dispoziție pentru muzeu fosta Casă Culturală. În 1945 I.I. Russu va fi delegat pentru organizarea \"Muzeului Arheologic din Turda\u0026quot;, iar în 1947 - 1948 începe înjghebarea colecțiilor muzeului cu contribuția importantă a lui Ion Țigăra, primul director al instituției. Deschiderea muzeului va avea loc la 23 august 1951; la baza organizării lui au stat piesele de arheologie. \"Palatul voievodal\" de la Turda, care adăpostește muzeul, cunoscut și sub denumirile de: Casa Princiară, Conacul Princiar, Casa Bathory, este cea mai veche clădire medievală civilă din Turda. Monumentul poate fi datat la sfârșitul secolului al XVI-lea, dar are în componență și elemente mai vechi de factură gotică și renascentistă. Monumentul, renovat și refăcut de-a lungul anilor, își schimbă radical înfățișarea exterioară și interioară. Este vorba de renovările făcute după 1658, când clădirea a fost incendiată de trupele turco-tătare și după incendiul de la începutul secolului al XVIII-lea. Ultimele mari renovări atestate documentar s-au petrecut în anii 1818, 1886 - 1887, 1910 - 1913 și, începând cu anul 1951, în această clădire funcționează Muzeul de Istorie. Sunt conservate și valorificate expozițional piese de arheologie preistorică, colecția de ceramică romană: ceramică de import - terra sigillata și amfore, ceramică de proveniență locală - vase de uz comun, ceramică ștampilată, opaițe, teracote etc., statuete din bronz înfățișând diferite divinități, opaițe și sfeșnice din bronz, piese de echipament militar, arme și piese mărunte de bronz, monumente votive și funerare (stele, edicule, statui, lei, conuri de pin, sarcofage), elemente arhitectonice și materiale de construcție. Perioada medievală este ilustrată de tezaure monetare, piese de armură, convocatoare de breaslă, inscripții și unelte de minerit. Sala consacrată luptătorului memorandist dr. Ion Rațiu adăpostește documente, fotografii și fotocopii din epoca modernă. Colecția de etnografie: costume și piese componente ale costumului popular din zona Văii Arieșului, țesături, ceramică, icoane pe lemn și sticlă, piese de mobilier.","Contact person":"Anita Szotyori","County":"Cluj","Director":"Mariana Rotaru","E-mail address":["office@muzeulturda.com"],"Fax":["0264.311.826"],"Founded":"1943","General profile":"History","Historic Monument Building":"CJ-II-m-A-07794","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Turda","Main profile":"History, Archaeology","Museum code":"7025700","Name":"Turda History Museum","Phone":["0264.311.826"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7025700_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7025700_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7025700_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7025700_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7025700_05.jpg"],"Postal code":"401154","Time table":["Tuesday-Sunday: 10:00-17:00","Monday closed"],"Website":["http://muzeulturda.ro/"]},{"Access":"In the centre of the town, near the Central Park","Address":"Strada Mihai Viteazul nr. 6","Administrative subordination":"Gherla City Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d213\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-Gherla-Gherla-Cluj","Collection(s)":"The exhibits include Paleolithic and Neolithic items, Metal Age artefacts, Dacian tools, military diplomas from the Roman camp of Gherla (2nd century), one of them dated 123; ethnography: fishing and bee-keeping tools, wood and glass icons; lapidarium: 3 Roman inscriptions and 3 mediaeval ones; Armenian religious objects (mitres, chalices, crosses); the \"Petru Maior\" Lyceum year book collection (17 issues); numismatics; icons; heraldry and library (5,000 books).

The fortress of Gherla dates from 1540. It is known as prison from 1785. The Roman camp was destroyed by the construction of the wood factory in the ‘60s. The building housing the museum was built in early 18th century and was named Karaciany House (private property). It is in the Baroque style, has a ground floor and an upper floor and belongs to the listed buildings of the town. In 1905, it was sold to a Hungarian bank, and in 1910, it was bought by the Greco-Catholic Bishopric united with Rome in Gherla that used it as theological institute. Between 1940 and 1948, the building was used by the church as a home for priests. In 1948, it was nationalized and transformed into school for apprentices, and later as council houses. In 1976, the restoration began and the building turned into a museum. In 1993, it became the property of the united Greco-Catholic Bishopric, but it continued to be a museum. The building is under restoration. It was established under the name of the Armenian Museum, was reorganized in 1952, and based on older collections and newl researches.

Destinația inițială a fost aceea de Restaurant și Hotel ,,Lemnul Verde”, în perioada interbelică își schimbă denumirea în Restaurant și Hotel \"Europa\". După al doilea război mondial intră în proprietatea statului și își păstrează profilul cu noi denumiri: \"Drapelul Roșu\" și mai târziu \"Someșul\". În anul 1997 muzeul a fost evacuat din localul unde funcționa - Claustrul Mănăstirii Franciscane - și printr-o hotărâre a Consiliului Local Dej i se atribuie această clădire. În 1899 membrii \"Societății pentru literatură, istorie și etnografie a comitatului Solnoc-Dăbâca\" pun bazele unei colecții muzeale care cuprinde 3.791 piese de arheologie, artă, etnografie etc., pe lângă Liceul de Stat din Dej. În 1900, în urma unui control din partea Inspectoratului muzeelor, s-a dispus desființarea acesteia din cauza condițiilor necorespunzătoare de întreținere și funcționare. Până în 1904 materialele au fost transferate la Muzeul Ardelean din Cluj și la Muzeul de Belle-Arte din Budapesta. În 1925 Consiliul orașului a luat hotărârea de a pune bazele unui mic muzeu comunal, iar în 1932 este semnat \"Regulamentul Muzeului și Bibliotecii Orașului Dej\". La 8 septembrie 1940 orașul a fost invadat de horttyști, care au devastat muzeul, iar directorul Liviu Deac este forțat să se refugieze. La întoarcerea lui, în 1944, încearcă să recupereze resturile risipite ale muzeului, dar autoritățile kominterniste ard o parte din patrimoniul muzeistic și de carte veche. În 1952 - 1953 patrimoniul este mutat la parterul Prefecturii (în actualul edificiu al Primăriei). În 1968 muzeul ajunge de rang municipal și reușește să se extindă în clădirea vechii Primării, dar în 1974, în condiții de totală insecuritate, i se impune să se mute în alt spațiu, în demisolul igrasios al Claustrului franciscan. Colecția de artă plastică și decorativă cuprinde picturi și sculpturi realizate de studenții Institutului de Arte Plastice “Nicolae Grigorescu” din București, ele fiind donate muzeului în anul 1971, prin grija prof. univ. dr. Raoul Șorban. Colecția de arheologie cuprinde descoperiri arheologice realizate pe teritoriul municipiului Dej, dar și în împrejurimile orașului. Piesele descoperite pot fi clasificate în funcție de epoca cărora aparțin după cum urmează: preistorie - din această perioadă au fost descoperite și se află în muzeu mai multe piese litice (lame din silex, topoare din piatră cioplită sau șlefuită, dălți și răzuitoare din piatră, brăzdare de plug, greutăți din piatră, mojar și piuliță din piatră), fragmente de vase ceramice, greutăți din ceramică și alte ustensile din os sau corn. O categorie aparte o constituie resturile fosile ale unor mamuți: defense, molari și oase. Epoca bronzului este bine reprezentată în colecția muzeului și are în inventar diferite piese de bronz: topoare de diferite tipuri și mărimi, seceri, lame de cuțit, brățări simple sau spiralate, inele, verigi, vârfuri de lance, piese de harnașament și chiar material brut neprelucrat (cocă de bronz). Alte descoperiri din epoca bronzului costau din fragmente de vase din ceramică și greutăți din ceramică pentru războiul de țesut. Din perioada clasică (daco-romană) se păstrează în muzeu vase ceramice, urne funerare, obiecte și unelte din fier. Cele mai multe piese le reprezintă inscripțiile romane (altare votive sau funerare), fragmente arhitectonice, tuburi ceramice de aducțiunea apei, fragmente ceramice, opaițe, arme, monezi și alte obiecte. Toate aceste piese au fost descoperite în castrul roman de Cășeiu - Samum, aflat la 6 Km de Dej. Epoca prefeudală este mai slab reprezentată din cauza lipsei unei cercetări arheologice sistematice în zona Dejului. Totuși există descoperiri izolate importante, ar fi de amintit opaițul de bronz cu însemne creștine (crucea și porumbelul - simbolul Sfântului Duh), datat în secolul al IV-lea, acesta se află în colecția Muzeului Național de Istorie din București Colecția de istorie cuprinde mai multe categorii de obiecte muzeistice: steme și blazoane nobiliare sculptate în piatră, arme și echipament militar (săbii, iatagane, vârfuri de lance, halebarde, flinte, puști, pistoale, căști, lăzi de campanie etc.) din diferite perioade istorice, lăzi de breaslă, unelte ale meșterilor, steaguri, ștampile și convocatoare de breaslă, vase din ceramică, documente istorice originale sau fotocopiate, cărți vechi scrise în limba slavonă, latină, maghiară și germană. Colecția de știință și tehnică în cadrul muzeului există o secție destinată istoriei mineritului - exploatarea sării de la Ocna Dej. Aici pot fi văzute unelte medievale ale minerilor, o balanță veghe de cântărit sarea, o roabă din lemn pentru transportul sării, un scripete pentru urcat sarea la suprafață, lămpi ale minerilor cu petrol, machete ale unor utilaje contemporane, documente fotocopiate care atestă privilegiile primite de mineri de la regii și principii maghiari, imagini din salină. O secțiune bine reprezentată în cadrul muzeului o reprezintă colecția numismatică care numără peste 2.000 de monede, din perioade diferite (secolele XIV - XX). O descoperire aparte, aflată in muzeu, o reprezintă tezaurul monetar descoperit întâmplător la Nireș (în apropierea Dejului), format din 30 de monede de argint. Colecția iconografică este formată din icoane vechi pictate pe lemn din secolele XVIII - XIX. Ele redau reprezentări ale unor Sfinți, Iisus Hristos în diferite ipostaze, Fecioara Maria și alte scene biblice. În Galeria de artă, inaugurată la 4 martie 1972, se organizează expoziții temporare, în special de artă plastică contemporană.","County":"Cluj","Director":"Constantin Albinetz","E-mail address":["muzeul_dej@yahoo.com"],"Founded":"1957","General profile":"History","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Dej","Main profile":"History","Museum code":"7024900","Name":"Dej City Museum","Phone":["0264.212.525"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024900_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024900_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024900_03.jpg"],"Postal code":"405200","Social media":["http://dejulmeu.ro/index.php/2018/01/26/muzeul-de-istorie-din-dej-in-anul-centenarului-marii-uniri/"],"Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 08:00 - 16:00","Monday: closed"],"Website":["http://turism-dej.ro/resurse-turistice/obiective-turistice/muzeul-municipal-dej"]},{"Access":"Near Hoia Forest; Buses: 26, 27, 28, 30, 41 (\"Piața 14 iulie\" Station)","Address":"Strada Tăietura Turcului","Administrative subordination":"Cluj County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d217\u0026-Parcul-Etnografic-„Romulus-Vuia”-Cluj-Napoca-Cluj","Collection(s)":"The open-air museum has about 200 constructions.

În 1922 ministerul transferă problema înființării muzeului din Cluj pe seama Fundației Culturale \"Principele Carol\", care numește o comisie pentru a face propuneri în vederea înființării acestuia. Comisia însărcinează pe Romulus Vuia să efectueze, în lunile august-septembrie 1922, o campanie de cercetări și achiziții în Pădureni și Țara Hațegului. Această campanie s-a finalizat cu formarea unei colecții de 1.230 de obiecte și 160 fotografii etnografice, colecție care a stat la baza recunoașterii oficiale a Muzeului Etnografic al Ardealului. În perioada 1922 - 1925 muzeul a funcționat în clădirea Muzeului de Arte și Meserii de pe strada G. Barițiu nr. 5. În această clădire, în primăvara anului 1925, se deschide prima expoziție cu obiectele achiziționate din Pădureni și Țara Hațegului. În perioada 1925 - 1935 muzeul a funcționat în clădirea din Piața Mihai Viteazu. La 17 iunie 1928 se deschide oficial expoziția de bază în această clădire. Nucleul palatului \"Reduta\", care adăpostește din 1959 Muzeul Etnografic al Transilvaniei, datează din secolul al XVI-lea. Aici a funcționat în secolele XVIII - XIX unul dintre cele mai importante hanuri ale orașului. Expoziția cuprindea următoarele sectoare tematice: cules din natură, vânătoare, pescuit, agricultură, creșterea animalelor, industria casnică textilă, cojocărit, ceramică, mobilier, elemente de construcție, vase de bucătărie, port popular, cusături-țesături, hărți etnografice. După Dictatul de la Viena (30 august 1940) muzeul se refugiază la Sibiu, unde funcționează până la 13 iulie 1945. Muzeul este reorganizat în 1958, iar colecția este masiv îmbogățită în ultimii 30 de ani, patrimoniul ajungând la peste 55.000 de piese. Expoziția permanentă actuală din cadrul secției pavilionare este structurată pe următoarele sectoare tematice: vânătoare, pescuit, păstorit și creșterea animalelor, agricultură, prelucrarea fibrelor textile, cojocărit, olărit, extragerea și prelucrarea metalelor, costume populare, covoare, obiceiuri tradiționale. Muzeul dispune și de o bibliotecă cu 12.000 de volume.","County":"Cluj","Director":"Tudor Sălăgean","E-mail address":["contact@muzeul-etnografic.ro"],"Fax":["0264.704.428"],"Founded":"1922","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Regional","Locality":"Cluj-Napoca","Main profile":"Ethnogaphy","Museum code":"7024600","Name":"Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania","Phone":["0264.708.953","0783.005.146"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024600_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024600_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024600_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024600_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024600_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024600_06.jpg"],"Postal code":"400114","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d217\u0026-Parcul-Etnografic-„Romulus-Vuia”-Cluj-Napoca-Cluj","Museum code":"7024601","Name":"\"Romulus Vuia\" Ethnographic Park"}],"Time table":["Wednesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 17:00 (winter)","10:00 - 18:00 (summer)","Monday, Tuesday: closed"],"Website":["http://www.muzeul-etnografic.ro/"]},{"Accreditation":["O.M.C. nr. 2196/02.04.2014 Acreditare","O.M.C. nr. 2926/11.06.2020 Reacreditare"],"Address":"Piața Unirii nr. 30","Administrative subordination":"Cluj County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d218\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-Cluj-Napoca-Cluj-Napoca-Cluj","Collection(s)":"Muzeul este adăpostit într-un important edificiu baroc din secolul al XVIII-lea, opera arhitectului german Johann Eberhard Blaumann, și posedă un patrimoniu deosebit de valoros de artă românească și europeană: pictură, grafică și artă decorativă (secolele XV - XX). Înființat în anul 1951, muzeul a beneficiat, încă de la constituirea sa, de unele fonduri mai vechi: o mică parte din colecția de curiozități, orfevrărie, piese de mobilier și artă plastică europeană, provenind de la Muzeul Ardelean și mai ales colecția cunoscută sub numele \u0026quot;Pinacoteca Virgil Cioflec\". De numele lui Virgil Cioflec (1876 - 1948), autor al unor monografii de referință dedicate pictorilor Ștefan Luchian (1924) și Nicolae Grigorescu (1925), precum și al unor scrieri pertinente despre artă publicate în presa vremii, se leagă un act de cultură de mare însemnătate pentru viața Clujului interbelic: donarea colecției sale de artă românească, Universității Clujene (1929 - 1930). Deschiderea către public a pinacotecii Virgil Cioflec (1933) însemna, de fapt, deschiderea la Cluj a primului muzeu de artă românească modernă, al cărui succesor a devenit Muzeul Național de Artă Cluj. Alcătuită cu pasiunea și competența cunoscătorului capabil să prețuiască valorile consacrate (Nicolae Grigorescu, Ștefan Luchian, Dimitrie Paciurea) și să susțină cu clarviziune afirmarea talentelor autentice (Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu, Vasile Popescu, Jean Al. Steriadi, Lucian Grigorescu, Oscar Han, Cornel Medrea), Colecția Virgil Cioflec reprezintă și astăzi nucleul valoric al patrimoniului Muzeului Național de Artă Cluj. Amplificarea fondului muzeal s-a realizat în anii care au urmat înființării lui, pe seama unor transferuri, donații și achiziții. Operelor de artă transferate de către Ministerul Culturii, Muzeul Național de Artă București și Administrația locală (Barbu Iscovescu, Constantin David Rosenthal, Theodor Aman, Gheorghe Tattarescu, Gheorghe Panaitescu Bagdasare, Carol Popp de Szathmary, Ioan Andreescu, Karl Storck) li se adaugă un fond însemnat provenind de la Filiala Cluj a Academiei Române (1971). Cuprinzând piese importante de artă din Transilvania (pictori necunoscuți din secolele XVIII - XIX, Franz Neuhauser, Joseph Neuhauser, Franz Anton Bergman, Koreh Sigismund, Szathmari Gati Sandor, Simo Ferenc), acest fond a contribuit substanțial la conturarea unei fizionomii a patrimoniului. Spațiul de la etajul palatului este destinat Galeriei Naționale. În anul 1990, Galeria Națională a fost închisă pentru reorganizare, impusă atât de starea avansată de degradare a edificiului, cât și de nevoia de a organiza expunerea permanentă în funcție de noile cercetări și de piesele achiziționate sau donate în ultimul timp. Galeria Națională, redeschisă pentru public în luna ianuarie 1996 propune o sinteză de patru secole de artă românească cu un accent firesc pe fenomenul artistic din Transilvania: Altarul de la Jimbor (secolul al XVI-lea), pictură Biedermeier, artă stil 1900, avangarda, artiștii legați de Școala Superioară de Arte Frumoase și de Centrul Artistic Cluj: Alexandru Popp, Szolnay Sandor, Pericle Capidan, Catul Bogdan, Aurel Ciupe, Romul Ladea, Petre Abrudan, Tasso Marchini, Alexandru Mohy, Szervatius Jeno, Theodor Harsia, Kovaks Zoltan, Nagy Albert, Anton Lazăr, Virgil Fulicea, Constantin Dinu Ilea, Ioan Sima, Egon Mark Lovith.","County":"Cluj","Director":"Lucian Nastasă-Kovács","E-mail address":["macn@cluj.astral.ro"],"Fax":["0264.596.952","0264.596.953"],"Founded":"1951","General profile":"Arts","Historic Monument Building":"CJ-II-m-A-07497","Importance":"County","Locality":"Cluj-Napoca","Main profile":"Art","Museum code":"7024500","Name":"Art Museum","Phone":["0264.596.952","0264.596.953"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7024500_02.jpg"],"Postal code":"400098","Time table":["Wednesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 17:00","Monday, Tuesday: closed"],"Website":["http://www.macluj.ro/"]},{"Access":"DN E70 Caransebeș - Timișoara","Administrative subordination":"Caraș Severin County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d199\u0026-Expozitia-arheologica-a-sitului-roman-Tibiscum-Jupa-Caras-Severin","Collection(s)":"The archaeological site from the Roman period near the village of Jupa has been the most thoroughly excavated in Banat and the best known in the archaeological literature.

Tibiscum lay close to the capital of the province Colonia Ulpia Traiana Dacica Sarmizegetusa, and its territory belonged to it. The place where the ancient Tibiscum was raised is known under the name of \"Fortress\" or \"Over the Walls\". This complex of ruins includes a camp, a military vicus and the civil settlement, that is the city. C. Mannert identified the ancient ruins preserved close to the locality of Jupa as Tibiscum at the beginning of the 19th century. The first archaeological excavations began in 1875 due to Ortvay Tivadar, on the right bank of the Timiș River, uncovering the largest part of the civil settlement. Between 1923 and 1924 Professor G. G. Mateescu, from the University of Cluj, conducted the first systematic excavations at Tibiscum. From 1977, the archaeological area found on the left bank of the Timiș River, including the camp and a part of the military vicus, was organized in the Tibiscum Archaeological Reservation.

His operas and ballads have been translated into more than 50 languages, and he has translated several of Shakespeare\u0027s plays into Hungarian. His masterpiece is the epic poem Toldi. By publishing this poetic novel, Arany became known, valued and considered a great national poet. Toldi is also translated into Romanian by the translator Gelu Păteanu. He was president of the Kisfaludy Society and secretary of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was born in Salonta in 1817, the tenth child of a poor family. Of the ten brothers, only two survived to adulthood. The poet\u0027s birthplace was a simple, modest property that fell into flames when the poet was six years old. The house was renovated in 2008 and at that time, it got its image, which can still be seen today, the thatched roof, the familiar rooms in the old houses of Salonta. An oven was built in the room across the street, as it probably was in Arany\u0027s childhood, and the furniture in the house was assembled from contemporary objects. The memorial house in its current form, from 2009, can be visited as an ethnographic museum, housing the utensils and objects used every day, at that time, by the people of Salont.

The watchtower was built from the ruins of buildings (churches) destroyed around the city. In 1658, in order to defend the fortress from the Turkish invasion, Rákóczi György II ordered the city to be abandoned and the fortifications set on fire. The name under which it is known today, the Ciunt Tower, is due to the fact that for a period of 240 years it remained without a roof. The Ciunt Tower Museum is also over a hundred years old. Arany László, the son of the great poet, with generous support, tried to promote the perpetuation of his father\u0027s memory in his hometown, both spiritually and financially. He donated to the museum all the furniture, the academic office in Budapest, some clothes and several small and personal things, the library, the manuscripts. Between 1885 and 1889, the collection was arranged in a classroom of the General School in Salonta. With the financial support of the poet\u0027s son, the renovation of the tower began in 1898. The restoration work was carried out by Veres Károly, according to the project of the architect Gyulas Laszló. The opening took place on August 27, 1899, as part of a grand national ceremony. In 1907 the access to the tower moved from the south side to the west side and on September 15 in the niche above the new entrance is the stone statue of Arany Janos, executed by Kolozsvári Szeszák Ferenc after the project of Strobl Alajos. On the occasion of the bicentennial of the great poet\u0027s birth, the renovation of the building and the entire collection began, with the support of the Petőfi Literary Museum in Budapest. In 2018, the new exhibition was opened in front of visitors. An introduction to the history of the city of Salonta is presented on the ground floor. The first floor tells the life of the great poet, Arany János, the second floor is an art gallery, including portraits and paintings about the poet, the third floor restores the atmosphere of his office with his personal furniture, and the fourth floor, in addition to toys designed for all ages, you can admire the wonderful view of the city.","Contact person":"Darvasi Zoltan","County":"Bihor","Director":"Gali Boglárka","E-mail address":["aranymuzeumnagyszalonta@gmail.com"],"Founded":"1885","General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"BH-II-m-B-00997","Importance":"County","Locality":"Salonta","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"7009500","Name":"\"Arany Janos\" Memorial Museum","Phone":["0259.371.157"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7009500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7009500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7009500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7009500_04.jpg"],"Position":"Referent","Postal code":"415500","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 10:00 - 16:00","Monday closed"],"Website":["http://salonta.net/ro/complexmuzeal/"]},{"Address":"Strada Matei Basarab nr. 30","Administrative subordination":"Oradea City Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d126\u0026-Gradina-Zoologica-Oradea-Oradea-Bihor","Collection(s)":"Animals from local and foreign fauna.","County":"Bihor","Founded":"1960","General profile":"Natural Sciences","Importance":"County","Locality":"Oradea","Main profile":"Natural Sciences - Zoology","Museum code":"7009100","Name":"Zoological Garden","Phone":["0259.134.547"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/7009100_01.jpg"],"Postal code":"410095","Time table":["8:00 - 19:00 (summer)","9:00 - 16:00 (winter)"],"Website":["http://www.zooradea.ro/"]},{"Access":"Town centre, near the Town Park","Address":"Piața Samuil Vulcan nr. 1","Administrative subordination":"Beiuș City Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d122\u0026-Muzeul-Municipal-Beius-Beius-Bihor","Collection(s)":"The building is a historic monument, the former house of the writer Vasile Ignat and of the martyr Ioan Ciordaș.

A fost construită pe latura nordică a zidului de incintă, în stil gotic transilvănean, fiind alcătuită din Turnul Porții, datând din secolul al XIV-lea, și un edificiu adosat laturii sale vestice, pe axa EV, din secolele XVI - XVII. Construit inițial pentru prelații Bisericii romano-catolice, în 1538 este menționat drept castel de către un proprietar cu preocupări militare. În 1556 ajunge în proprietatea principilor transilvăneni, împreună cu restul domeniilor capitlului Bisericii catolice. Între 1613 - 1629 a aparținut principelui Gabriel Bethlen. În funcție de aceste stăpâniri, edificiul a fost denumit Castelul/Palatul Princiar sau Castelul/Casa Bethlen. Mai târziu va purta denumirea de Casa Nobililor. De-a lungul timpului, clădirea a cunoscut mai multe modificări la acoperiș, la ancadramentele ușilor și deschiderile ferestrelor, mai ales în secolele XVII - XVIII, dar și XIX. În jurul anului 1940 edificiului i-au fost alipite câteva anexe. Clădirea a beneficiat doar de câteva reparații, în urmă cu peste două decenii. Sunt expuse piese de istorie veche și arheologie datând din neolitic până în evul mediu timpuriu: depozite de bronzuri hallstattiene (Cetea, Crizbav, Aiud, Zagon, Șpălnaca I și II), piese scitice și celtice, coiful militar roman de bronz de la Lunca Mureșului, monumente romane epigrafice și sculpturale, obiecte din villa rustica de la Aiudul de Sus. Ca instituție de cultură specifică, muzeul a luat ființă în 1796 sub denumirea de RARITATVM ET RERVM NATVRALIVM MVSEVM, pe lângă Colegiul Academic Reformat Bethlen. Inițial, valorile din domeniul istoriei au fost încadrate în grupa \"rarităților\", împreună cu anumite piese din domeniul științelor naturale. Abia în 1862, prof. Szathmary Karoly organizează prima colecție de antichități, inclusiv obiecte din epoci mai recente.

Established as a museum of the Hunting Association local branch, based on the collection of Professor Anghel Bardan, in 1951 that collection became an independent museum, owning a heritage of 334 pieces presenting hunting themes. After various reorganizations, in 1968 a modern museum reopened. Local representative ecosystems, with characteristic flora and fauna, were presented according to new ecological dioramatic principles. The earthquake from March 1977 damaged the buildings, the exhibits and a part of the heritage. In 1979, the museum became a department of Vrancea Museum Complex and moved in the present building. In 1989, an aquarium emerged in the semi-basement, presenting the exotic and local live water fauna and flora in the sixteen glass aquariums and nine large basins. In the same space the exhibition \"Water Living Creatures\" is organized. On the ground floor of the building one can visit the exhibition \"Wonderful World of Birds\", as the museum holds one of the largest bird collections in this country. Also on the ground floor there is the exhibition \"Hunting and Hunting Trophies\" displaying medal winning hunting trophies, as well as naturalized pieces (large and small mammals). Temporary exhibitions are held in an adjoining hall. There are 53,000 pieces in the museum heritage.

The monument was built in two stages: 1923 - 1924 and 1936 - 1938 (when the upper floor was built), and restored in 1973 - 1977 and 1983 - 1988. The initiative of building the Heroes\u0027 Mausoleum belongs to the National Orthodox Society of the Romanian Women at the Congress from the 8th of June 1919. The foundation stone was laid on the 6th of August 1923. On the 28th of September 1924 Queen Mary and other personalities of the time attended the inauguration of the crypts, and on the 18th of September 1938 King Charles II attended the mausoleum inauguration ceremony. In the summer of 1924 they began to rebury the remains of the soldiers fallen on the battlefield in the mausoleum crypts, and in August they deposited the remains of general Eremia Grigorescu, the commander of the 1st Romanian Army during the battles of Mărășești. The architects George Cristinel and C. Pomponiu, the sculptors Cornel Medrea and Ion Jalea and the painter Ed. Săulescu built and decorated the mausoleum. A separate building of the mausoleum precinct includes a museum presenting the battles waged on these places, offering the visitors photographs, documents, weaponry and military equipment in the endowment of the Romanian army at that time, and personal belongings of Ecaterina Teodoroiu, fallen during the battles waged on the Șușița Valley.","Commune":"Mărășești","Contact person":"Maria Mihăilescu","County":"Vrancea","Director":"Romeo Valentin Muscă","Founded":"1938","General profile":"Military History","Historic Monument Building":"VN-IV-m-A-06631","Importance":"County","Locality":"Mărășești","Main profile":"Military History","Museum code":"6981503","Name":"Mărășești Mausoleum","Part of":"Museum of Vrancea","Phone":["0237.260.574"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_16.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_17.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6981503_18.jpg"],"Position":"Muzeograf","Postal code":"625200","Time table":["Daily 9:00 - 18:00"],"Virtual tour":["https://turvirtual.real-tour.ro/view/muzeul-vrancei/mausoleul-eroilor-marasesti"],"Website":["http://muzeulvrancei.ro/"]},{"Accreditation":["O.M.C.I.N. nr. 2728/25.09.2018 Acreditare"],"Address":"Crângul Petrești","Administrative subordination":"Vrancea County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d681\u0026-Muzeul-Vrancei-Sectia-de-Arhitectura-si-Tehnica-populara-„Crangul-Petresti”-Petresti-Vrancea","Collection(s)":"The folk architecture reservation presents in open air traditional wooden constructions from the 18th and 19th centuries from Vrancea villages, water mills from Milcov Valley, rural workshops, an inn from Odobești, a village school.

It was designed to reconstruct the functional image of a traditional rural settlement, with all its social and cultural institutions on an eight hectare area. The organizers of this open air museum took into account a few basic factors of a true village - the forms of relief of the area, fireplace and its border with all its elements - depending on where the community homesteads and constructions moved from various localities of the Vâlcea county were placed. Currently, the museum is representative due to its four sectors: 1.The Homestead Sector - the dwelling comprises 42 units and over 12,000 museum artefacts, illustrating the homestead structure, according to the traditional trades: agriculture, fruit-growing, vinegrowing, animal breeding or a series of folk crafts and techniques; the diversity and planimetric and volumetric evolution of the dwellings with one or more rooms are emphasized. The remarkable exhibits include the houses with pavilion in the Horezu ethnographic area (in the communes of Măldărești, Stoenești, Bărbătești), the homesteads specializing in winegrowing, moved from Drăgășani (the villages of Prundeni, Olteanca), in fruit growing (the communes of Alunu, Tomșani, Cernișoara) or in animal breeding in the mountainous regions (the villages of Boișoara, Pâscoaia-Brezoi). Next to the dwellings, several adjoining constructions were moved to the homesteads: barns, sheds, haylofts, coops for food storage or for breeding birds and animals. 2. The Social - Cultural Sector of the \"public utility monuments\" includes a rural primary school from the beginning of the 20th century, from Spiru Haret\u0027s time; an inn from the end of the 19th century from the village of Săliște, the commune of Mălaia; a wooden church, built in 1785 and moved from the commune of Nicolae Bălcescu; a swing from the commune of Stoenești, and in the future this sector will be completed with other architectonic sites. 3.

The permanent exhibition opens with archaeological finds from the Palaeolithic, the Neolithic and the Bronze Age displayed according to the modern graphic pattern. It is worth mentioning the reconstructed Roman period archaeological sites of Stolniceni, Ocnița, the Roman camp of Arutela - Căciulata and the imperial silver coin hoard uncovered at Pădurețu (Babeni). The Romanian Middle Ages state is revealed by presenting the evolution of freeholder armies and governed villages, due to the emergence of high officials\u0027 families and of the Râmnic town life. Life in mediaeval Vâlcea is revealed by the finds from the central park of the town, from Inătești hermitage, Ostrov hermitage and from Budești, where hoards from the 16th century were found, as well as from some exhibits depicting original and copied documents from the 8th century. Other exhibits include art items from the 16th - 17th centuries, manufactured at Brașov or originating in the transition trade, that were displayed in two interiors: a peasant one and a boyar one.

It has a projecting semicircular apse, a rectangular naos divided into three naves by individual pillars, that used to support, in the vertical part of the edifice, a wooden ridged roof, covered by gutter tiles. It had no narthex, instead it used to have pilasters fastened at the south ends of the lateral valves, in order to sustain some transversal archways, and compartmentalized the interior space of the lateral naves, on both sides of the entrance to the central nave, a wide entrance situated on the apse axis. In the central zone of the apse, under the altar pavement, there is a monumental martyr crypt, completely buried, housing a group of four martyrs at the upper part of the martyrion - Zotikos, Attalos, Camasis and Philippos, and two martyrs on the lower level, that originate in an earlier martyr tomb. The martyrion at Niculițel is a unique monument in Europe. The protecting edifice creates an elegant, aired and pleasant interior. The perimetral gallery destined to the inflow of visitors ensures a permanent visual contact with the monument, and the permanent exhibition of paleo-Christian artefacts, colour photographs and slides complete the museum collection. The discovery of the monument is due to torrential rain in the spring of 1971 that uncovered a part of the crypt cupola. As it is in a sloping position, in an inhabited area, and at a crossroads, the monument needed to be long studied during the years 1971, 1975, 1985 and 1994.","Commune":"Niculițel","Contact person":"Cristian Micu, Cornelia Odagiu","County":"Tulcea","Director":"Sorin Ailincăi","E-mail address":["icemtl@icemtl.ro","relatiipublice@icemtl.ro"],"Fax":["0240.513.231"],"Founded":"1995","General profile":"Archaeology","Importance":"County","Locality":"Niculițel","Main profile":"Archaeology","Museum code":"6975508","Name":"Palaeo-Christian Monument","Part of":"Institute for Eco-Museum Researches \"Gavrilă Simion\"","Phone":["0240.513.231","0240.513.626"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975508_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975508_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975508_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975508_04.jpg"],"Position":"Director, supraveghetor","Postal code":"827165","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 10.00-18.00","Monday closed"],"Website":["http://www.icemtl.ro/"]},{"Address":"Strada Gloriei, Parcul Monumentul Independenței","Administrative subordination":"Tulcea County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d626\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-si-Arheologie-Tulcea-Tulcea","Collection(s)":"The museum holds archaeology collections of Northern Dobrudja, from prehistory, protohistory, the Graeco-Hellenistic period, the Daco-Roman period, the Middle Ages (pottery, glassware, tools, weapons, ornaments), ancient, mediaeval and modern coins (hoards with Roman, Genoese and Tartar pieces), a lapidarium (epigraphic and sculptural monuments).","Contact person":"Micu Cristian","County":"Tulcea","Director":"Sorin Ailincăi","E-mail address":["history@icemtl.ro","relatiipublice@icemtl.ro"],"Fax":["240.513231"],"Founded":"1975","General profile":"Archaeology","Importance":"County","Locality":"Tulcea","Main profile":"Archaeology","Museum code":"6975507","Name":"History and Archaeology Museum","Part of":"Institute for Eco-Museum Researches \"Gavrilă Simion\"","Phone":["0240.513.626"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975507_08.jpg"],"Position":"Director","Postal code":"820013","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 09:00 - 17:00 (summer), last admission 16:30","8:00 - 16:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"],"Website":["http://www.icemtl.ro/"]},{"Access":"DN 22 (Tulcea - Babadag); DJ Babadag - Enisala; Railway: Tulcea - Babadag","Administrative subordination":"County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d628\u0026-Gospodaria-taraneasca-de-la-Enisala-Enisala-Tulcea","Collection(s)":"The museum is located in the centre of the locality, and presents a synthesis of the traditional homestead in northern Dobrudja, and the area of Razim Lake, from early 20th century.

Construcția are la bază un proiect elaborat în 1924 și a fost ridicată în perioada interbelică (1924-1927), deci, la finele epocii de manifestare a curentului național în arhitectura României. Imobilul are o compoziție echilibrată generată și de poziționarea într-o intersecție, dar ș;i de funcționalitatea inițială. Acest edificiu public poate fi considerat un exemplar reușit al arhitecturii moderne, edificate pe valorile celei tradiționale, ce a marcat prima parte a secolului al XX-lea. Colecția de ștergare a Muzeului de Etnografie și Arta Populară este alcătuită din 2.385 piese ce aparțin diferitelor populații din această zonă. Prin funcția lor decorativă, ștergarele din Dobrogea se încadreaza în tipul de \"Ștergare de perete\". Același tip de stergar (local, \"peschir\"), de formă dreptunghiulară, îl întâlnim la români, bulgari, greci și ucraineni, dovadă a unui fenomen caracteristic zonei de conviețuire etnică. Realizat la războiul de țesut, din bumbac și borangic, ștergarul este decorat la capete cu motive alese, de asemenea, la războiul de țesut. Reprezentarea stilizată și geometrizantă, mai nerealistă, a motivelor cât și denumirile lor sugestive (\"unda apei\", \"morișca\", \"pomișorii\", \"coronița\", \"calul\"; \"calul și călăretul\", \"fetele\", \"steaua\") relevă o transfigurare artistică a naturii și a cotidianului. Ștergarele populației turcești și tătărăști sunt de forma dreptunghiulară (\"geaulac\") și de forma pătrată (\"cevre\"). Aceste piese erau utilizate cu rol decorativ doar în ceremonialul de nuntă și botez, în restul timpului fiind păstrate ca zestre. În ornamentica ștergarelor turcești și tătărăști distingem motive tipic orientale: \"panseaua\", \"zambila\", \"chiparosul\", \"floarea și fructul de rodie\", \"sacsaia\" etc. Motivele sunt brodate, în genere, cu fir de mătase, cu fir metalic auriu și argintiu. Colecția de ștergare cuprinde piese realizate atît la sfârșitul secolului al XIX-lea - începutul secolului al XX-lea, cât și piese de creație contemporană. În cadrul colecției de etnografie a Muzeului de Etnografie și Artă Populară, un număr de aproximativ 1.600 de piese reprezintă instrumentarul folosit în practicarea ocupațiilor și mesteșugurilor tradiționale, acestea reflectând adaptarea locuitorilor din zonă la un habitat cu totul deosebit în raport cu alte ținuturi. Gospodăria țărănească de la Enisala, conservata \"in situ\" este considerată un muzeu al satului dobrogean, prin colecția pe care o adăpostește și o oferă vizitatorului. În domeniul prelucrării produselor animale și vegetale în scop alimentar, colecția prezintă unelte, mijloace, dispozitive, instrumentar, arme, folosite la pescuit, apicultură, pomicultură, viticultură, prelucrarea semințelor, agricultură, morărit, creșterea animalelor, vânătoare. O serie de mijloace și tehnici reflectă preocuparea populației românești și de diferite alte etnii pentru prelucrarea materiilor prime în vederea obținerii unor materiale de construcție, a obiectelor de uz casnic, pentru confecționarea de unelte, scule, instrumente, dispozitive, arme și mijloace de transport, specifice activității în această zonă pentru civilizația preindustrială. Sunt reprezentate meștesuguri tradiționale ca: prelucrarea lemnului, a argilei, a pietrei, a vegetalelor (stuf, papură, paie). Pentru domeniul prelucrării pieilor, a blănurilor, a fibrelor vegetale și animale în vederea realizării pieselor de uz gospodăresc, a împletiturilor, a țesăturilor decorative sau necesare confecționării pieselor de port, colecția de etnografie ofera vizitatorilor o gamă largă de unelte, dispozitive, mecanisme, mijloace folosite în industria casnica : de cojocarie, curelărit, cizmarie, dărăcit, tors, urzit, țesut, cusut, împletit, melițat. Pentru ca toate aceste materiale, materii prime, prelucrate și uneltele folosite să fie transportate la locul activitătății s-au folosit mijloace de transport cu tracțiune manuală sau animală, pe uscat sau pe apă: roaba, căruța, cotiga, sanie, barcă. Un loc deosebit în cadrul patrimoniului etnografic al muzeului îl ocupă colecția vaselor de metal (267 piese). Colecția este diversă atît în ceea ce privește metalul folosit (aramă, fier, argint, plumb), cât și în ceea ce privește tehnica utilizată în confecționare și ornamentare (tăiere, perforare, ciocănire, laminare, lustruire, incizare, pilire, nituire, îndoire, turnare). În aliaje diferite cu zincul, staniul, argintul, arama are o diversitate mare în utilizarea ei: monede, arme, unelte, obiecte de podoabă, vase folosite frecvent în Peninsula Balcanică, deci și în Dobrogea, de diverse populații războinice, nomade, transhumante sau sedentare. Vasele de aramă, alamă, bronz, unele nichelate, alămite sau cositorite, se pot grupa astfel: căldare (bracaci sau bargaci, diminutiv bracacică), ulcior (ghium, diminutiv ghiumucic), ploscă, samovar, ceainic, fructieră, cafetieră, zaharniță, strecuratoare, cratiță (tingire), oala (cazan), lighean, cană, ibric, tavă (taval, tipsie, sinie, sofra), vase de cult creștin (cristelniță, aghiazmatar), vase de cult musulman (pentru spălat ritualic sau pentru ars mirodenii), alambicuri, prăjitor și râșnită cafea. Acestea sunt piese comune tuturor populațiilor care au folosit aramă (căldările, tăvile, cănile, ulcioarele, străchinile, crătițele, cazanele etc), piese specifice aromânilor (plosca, pahurul, zaharnița) sau piese specifice turco-tătarilor. Unele din aceste categorii sunt prețuite și utilizate și astăzi. Muzeul deține o colecție de covoare (155 de piese) de o valoare documentară și artistică deosebită. Realizate la războiul de țesut, din lână, covoarele au amplificat, prin utilizarea lor, frumusețea interiorului tradițional. Colecția cuprinde covoare de diferite dimensiuni, de la cele înguste și lungi plasate pe perete (paretar) sau acoperind una din piesele de mobilier tradițional (lăicer) până la cele mari, de formă dreptunghiulară și care acoperă, în genere, un perete (polog, scoarță, covor). Compozițiile decorative se remarcă printr-o evoluție de la simplu la complex, de la repetiția și alternanța unui număr de dungi la asocieri diverse ale motivelor geometrice, avimorfe și zoomorfe, florale sau antropomorfe. Denumirile motivelor sunt sugestive și reflectă legatura omului cu natura, preocupările lui cotidiene (aripile morii, unda apei, oul încondeiat, floarea pologului, viță de vie). Maniera de reprezentare a motivelor variază de la cea stilizată și geometrizată la cea liber desenată. Se disting în cadrul colecției, covoare cu compoziții complexe formate din buchete de flori, păsări, scene de viață urbană, interpretate naturalist și dispuse în medalioane. Cromatica variază între culorile discrete (tonuri de verde, ocru, bleumarin, albastru-închis) și cele tari (galben, portocaliu, roșu). Negrul (culoare de fond, în genere) și albul (folosit pentru evidențierea unor motive) echilibrează compozițiile cromatice. Aromânii constituie populația autohtonă romanizată din sudul Peninsulei Balcanice, dăinuind pâna astăzi în numeroase localități din Grecia, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia-Muntenegru. Între cele două războaie mondiale, ca urmare a înțelegerii intervenite între statul roman și celelalte state din sud-estul Europei, o parte din aromâni s-au strămutat în Dobrogea, la început în județele Durostor și Caliacra, care aparțin astăzi Bulgariei, de unde în 1940 s-au strămutat în județele Constanța și Tulcea. Prezența aromânilor în Dobrogea se relevă, din perspectiva conservării tradițiilor, prin patrimoniul pe care îl detine Muzeul de Etnografie și Arta Populară: 670 de piese (țesături de uz casnic și decorative, port popular). Țesăturile groase, policrome, de lana sau par de capra, detineau ponderea în casa aromâneasca traditionala. Ansamblul decorativ al țesăturilor (\"doaga anflucata’’, \"tenda’’, \"misale’’etc) se distinge prin alăturarea unor suprafețe de o mare sobrietate (grena, negru) cu pete de culoare ce imprima o anume luminozitate (roșu, galben, violet, verde). Portul tradițional al aromânilor face parte din marea și diversificata categorie a costumului balcanic. Costumul aromânesc, atat în varianta lui masculina cat și în cea feminina, se compune din piese numeroase și diverse (\" chiptare’’, \"fustane’’, \"canduse’’, \"poi’’, \"giumidane’’, \"sarica’’, \"cioariti’’, \"parpodzi’’ etc). Portul traditional aromânesc se evidentiază printr-un deosebit simț al valorilor plastice, de tip sculptural. Menționăm prezența în compoziția costumului aromânesc a podoabelor care imprima o anume strălucire și care sunt confecționate dintr-un aliaj de argint. Podoabele sunt folosite cu precădere în costumul femeiesc (\"tasul’’- un fel de disc prins pe caciula de postav; \"mardzeale’’- mărgele, cingătoare cu paftale - \"ploci’’, cercei - \"minghiusi’’). În portul barbatesc întîlnim o singura podoabă și anume lanțul de prins briceagul (\"chiusteca di custura’’). În execuția pieselor de podoabă (cca. 100 în colecția muzeului) se folosesc tehnici străvechi (filigranul, ciocănirea \"au repoussé’’, gravarea, intarsia).","Contact person":"Iuliana Titov","County":"Tulcea","Director":"Sorin Ailincăi","E-mail address":["etno@icemtl.ro","relatiipublice@icemtl.ro"],"Fax":["0240.513.231"],"Founded":"1989","General profile":"Ethnography","Historic Monument Building":"TL-II-m-B-05972","Importance":"County","Locality":"Tulcea","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"6975502","Name":"Museum of Ethnography and Folk Art","Part of":"Institute for Eco-Museum Researches \"Gavrilă Simion\"","Phone":["0240.516.204"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_16.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_17.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_18.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_19.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975502_20.jpg"],"Position":"Șef serviciu","Postal code":"820026","Social media":["http://meaptulcea.wordpress.com/"],"Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 09:00 - 18:00 (summer)","8:00 - 16:00 (winter)","Monday closed"],"Website":["http://www.icemtl.ro/"]},{"Address":"Strada Grigore Antipa nr. 2","Administrative subordination":"Tulcea County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d620\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-Tulcea-Tulcea","Collection(s)":"The Art Museum is hosted by a neoclassical building, raised between 1863 and 1865, as an administrative palace of Tulcea Sangeac, called at the time Pasha\u0027s Mansion, that underwent changes in time. After Dobrudja reunited with Romania, it became the headquarters of the Tulcea County Prefecture in 1878. On the ground floor there were the County Court of Justice, the quarters of the bailiffs and the Jury Court. Between 1950 and 1970, it functioned as the Tulcea District Council. It became the quarters of the Art Museum on the 23rd of August 1982. The Tulcea Art Museum takes pride in holding a significant heritage that constantly grew over the last ten years, from 4,365 by the end of the year 1991, to 7,015 works currently, so that it owns seven collections, as follows: the modern and contemporary painting collection, counting 932 works; the modern and contemporary sculpture collection, counting 420 works; icon collection from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, counting 797 works; modern and contemporary graphics collection, counting 4,016 works; engraving plates collection (unique in this country), counting 400 works; the Oriental decorative art collection from the 18th and 20th centuries, counting 311 pieces; the decorative art collection from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, counting 139 pieces. Following the theme of \"Dobrudja Reflected in Romanian Fine Art\", the museum presents in the galleries of the permanent exhibition works of great national and international value, that could engender the envy of the great museums. They are works of modern and contemporary graphics and painting, including works by artists, such as: Gheorghe Petrașcu, Nicolae Tonitza, Theodor Pallady, Ștefan Popescu, Petre Iorgulescu Yor, Jean Al. Steriadi, Francisc Șirato, Ștefan Dimitrescu, Nicolae Dărăscu, Ion Theodorescu Sion, Vasile Popescu, Samuel Mützner, Rodica Maniu, Marius Bunescu, Cecilia Cuțescu Storck, Gheorghe Sârbu, Stavru Tarasov, Leon Biju, Ion Țuculescu, Iosif Iser, Lucia Dem. Bălăcescu, Dimitrie Gheață, Michaela Eleutheriade, and Paul Miracovici. That school of the Black Sea, of the Danube and of the Dobrudjan sunlight, although outstanding, is a natural part of Romanian art, as it was preceded by works of the great masters from the end of the 19th century and early 20th century: Theodor Aman, Nicolae Grigorescu, Ion Andreescu, Ștefan Luchian, George Demetrescu Mirea, Sava Henția, Nicolae Vermont, a.s.o. The museum owns remarkable sculptures by the representative artists of Romanian art: Ioan Georgescu, Dimitrie Paciurea, Frederic Storck, Ion Jalea, Oscar Han, Milița Pătrașcu, Alexandru Călinescu, Constantin Baraschi, Ion Irimescu, Ioana Kassargian, a.s.o. The most valuable works of this collection is undoubtedly that from the vanguard collection represented here by: Hans Mattis Teutsch, Max Hermann Maxy, Marcel Iancu, Corneliu Michăilescu, culminating with the 14 works (ten paintings, four graphics) signed by the well known artist famous all over the world, Victor Brauner. The exhibition ends with the contemporary period represented, along others, by: Corneliu Baba, Henry Catargi, Iulian Olariu, Ana Asvadurova and Alexandru Ciucurencu, from Tulcea, a school founder. The heritage also comprises outstanding paintings and graphics by contemporary artists. in one room of the first floor are exhibited items originating from the transfer of Oriental Art Museum collections.

Muzeul tulcean a luat naștere în anul 1950, prin organizarea Muzeul de Științe ale Naturii. Din anul 1965 a început să funcționeze sub denumirea de Muzeul \"Delta Dunării\" cu 4 secții: istorie și arheologie, etnografie, știinte ale naturii, artă, fiind primul și singurul muzeu tematic din România acceptat la acea vreme, cu denumirea de Muzeul Deltei Dunării. În timp, muzeul s-a extins prin organizarea altor unități muzeale. Cea mai importantă realizare este organizarea în 1975 a Secției de istorie și arheologie din Parcul \"Monumentul Independenței\", în interiorul unui prim pavilion, ulterior extinsă prin construcția celui de-al doilea edificiu. Alte realizări importante se referă la organizarea Muzeului de Arta (1972) și a Muzeului de Etnografie și Artă Populară (1989). Implicarea instituției muzeale tulcene în diversificarea unor forme de valorificare a întregului patrimoniu cultural a dus, în cele din urmă, la modificarea structurii organizatorice a vechiului Muzeu al Deltei Dunarii și transformarea lui în Institut de Cercetări Eco-Muzeale. Legiferarea și reorganizarea muzeului tulcean s-au făcut prin deciziile nr. 118, 119/19 martie 1993, Institutul urmând să-și desfășoare activitatea în domeniile: ecologie, etnologie, istoria artelor, istorie și arheologie. În prezent, fiecare obiectiv muzeal al Institutului desfășoară activitatea sa proprie prin care încearcă să îmbine riguros activitatea știintifică de cercetare, conservare, restaurare, valorificare și îmbogățire a patrimoniului cultural, cu acțiuni care să evidențieze activități sinergetice cu alte domenii. Noua strategie a instituției are în vedere faptul că produsul său cultural trebuie dezvoltat într-un context de integrare care să implice educația, turismul, dezvoltarea regională, cooperarea transfrontalieră și transnațională, urmărind crearea unor efecte multiplicatoare prin acțiuni pluridisciplinare. Istorie și arheologie (pre și protoistorie, greco-elenistică, daco-romană, medievală), tezaure monetare cu piese romane, genoveze, tătărești; științele naturii; artă plastică și decorativă; etnografie; bibliofilie, carte veche, bibliotecă (peste 87.000 volume).","County":"Tulcea","Director":"Sorin Ailincăi","E-mail address":["icemtl@icemtl.ro","relatiipublice@icemtl.ro"],"Fax":["0240.513.231"],"Founded":"1953","General profile":"Archaeology","Historic Monument Building":"TL-II-m-B-05994","Importance":"Regional","Locality":"Tulcea","Main profile":"Archaeology","Museum code":"6975500","Name":"Institute for Eco-Museum Researches \"Gavrilă Simion\"","Phone":["0240.513.231"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6975500_02.jpg"],"Postal code":"820009","Social media":["https://www.facebook.com/pages/ICEM-TULCEA/488819324511901"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d619\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Panait-Cerna”-Cerna-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975505","Name":"\"Panait Cerna\" Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d628\u0026-Gospodaria-taraneasca-de-la-Enisala-Enisala-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975506","Name":"Enisala Homestead Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d697\u0026-Monumentul-Paleocrestin-Niculitel-Niculitel-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975508","Name":"Palaeo-Christian Monument"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2109\u0026-Muzeul-de-arta-orientala-Orasul-Babadag-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975504","Name":"Oriental Art Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1536\u0026-Muzeul-„Farul-Vechi”-Sulina-Sulina-Tulcea","Museum code":"51620000153","Name":"\"Old Lighthouse of Sulina\" Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1827\u0026-Casa-Avramide-Casa-Colectiilor-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975509","Name":"\"Avramide\" House - Collections House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d624\u0026-Centrul-Muzeal-Ecoturistic-„Delta-Dunarii”-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975503","Name":"Danube Delta Eco-Touristic Centre"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d620\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-Tulcea-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975501","Name":"Art Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d625\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-Tulcea-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975502","Name":"Museum of Ethnography and Folk Art"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d626\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-si-Arheologie-Tulcea-Tulcea","Museum code":"6975507","Name":"History and Archaeology Museum"}],"Website":["http://www.icemtl.ro/"]},{"Administrative subordination":"Satu Mare County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1752\u0026-Casa-Taraneasca-„Iacob-Macut”-Calinesti-Oas-Satu-Mare","Collection(s)":"The house was built in 1727, respecting the traditional architectural characteristics.

Hanul Domnesc: clădire cu două niveluri, construită la sfârșitul secolului al XVI-lea și începutul celui următor, a fost destinată găzduirii unor dregători străini, oaspeți de seamă și mari negustori. Odată cu ocuparea nordului Moldovei de către imperiul Habsburgic în 1775, Hanul Domnesc își schimbă destinația, devenind casă de vânătoare pentru membri familiei imperiale. În 1962 a fost restaurat de la nivelul pivniței până la acoperiș, urmărindu-se reconstituirea elementelor de arhitectură interioară de la parter, în fosta bucătărie a hanului, pe locul cuptorului s-a ridicat un altul inspirat din cuptoarele moldovenești, la etaj s-au păstrat grinzile de stejar ale plafoanelor celor două coridoare. Ca elemente arhitecturale de epocă recâștigate odată cu refacerea zidurilor, construcția Hanului Domnesc ca monument de arhitectură a intrat în tradiția culturală a Sucevei ca vechi han medieval. Expoziția permanentă de la parterul clădirii reconstituie atmosfera de epocă a unui han care găzduiește oaspeții de seamă, dregători, negustori. Colecții: port popular, podoabe, țesături de interior, ceramică, unelte, ustensile, instalații, meșteșuguri, obiecte de uz gospodăresc, obiecte de iluminat, transport, elemente de arhitectură, mobilier țărănesc, obiecte de cult, recuzită obiceiuri populare, instrumente muzicale, obiective de arhitectură populară, case grajduri, biserica crâșmă, anexe gospodărești, diverse. În salonul privat este reconstituită o sobă de influență austriacă cu plăci de ceramică de tip Kuty, mobilat cu piese sculptate ornamentate cu motive populare tradiționale: masă cu scaune cu spătare înalte sculptate, dulap cu vitrină pentru veselă și piese de porțelan, sticlă și metal (farfurii, căni, suporturi pentru pahare, tăvi, tabacheră, lulea, etc.). Hanul Domnesc a fost într-o perioadă (sfârșitul secolului al XVIII-lea) casă de vânătoare, atmosfera acestei perioade fiind ilustrată cu obiecte specifice acestei ocupații - pe un rastel sunt expuse puști de vânătoare panoplie cu pistoale și pumnale. Ambianța salonului este completată cu blănuri de mistreț. Urmează cămara în care sunt obiecte de uz casnic necesare preparării hranei. Aici sunt râșnița de mână, teascul pentru ulei, cumpăna, cofa pentru apă, butoaie, butoiașe, balerci, saci pentru făină, tăvi de cpot, piuă. În bucătărie, elementul principal este cuptorul cu plită, rolă și cuptor de pâine. Vasele necesare sunt așezate pe un grilaj din jurul hornului (linguroaie, tăvi, tigăi, oale, căni); pe plită și pe vatră: oală pentru sarmale, chiup pentru borș, lopată, clește, cociorvă, piuă pentru sare. Mobilierul din bucătărie este cel specific: masă, blidare, laiță, lingurare. Circuitul de vizitare trece apoi în sala de han. Aici sunt mese cu laițe și scaune, poliță cu vase din ceramică, blidare , butoiașe, balerci, colțare. Pe masă sunt sfeșnice, strachini, linguri, fund de mămăligă. Această cameră este destinată servirii mesei. Inventarul mesei este completat cu textile de interior, ștergare de mână, țesături de cânepă. Urmează camera de odihnă cu mobilier specific: pat cu tăblii, banchetă, jilț, scrin , lavoar cu oglindă cu cană și lighean de porțelan. Interiorul acestei camere este completat cu țesături de factură populară: ștergare, așternut de pat, scoarță pentru perete și blană de urs pe perete și de mistreț pe jos. O sobă de încălzit și un cufăr pentru haine întregesc inventarul acestei încăperi care-și așteaptă oaspeții. Holul de intrare face legătura dintre celelalte spații. Acici sunt expuse piese de harnașament (șei, tarnițe, curele, hamuri) și obiecte legate de transport și vânătoare. Este expusă o căruță, un mic atelier de fierărie cu nicovală, ciocane, clești. Pivnița cu cele două camere legate printr-un culoar boltit constituie un punct de atracție prin arhitectura lor și prin reconstitiurea funcționalității lor. În spațiul de la intrare sunt expuse butoaie pentru băuturi și pentru alimente, iar în a doua încăpere este amenajată o cramă cu mese și laițe cu obiecte din lemn și ceramică. Interacțiunea dintre reconstituirea interioarelor specifice hanului și prezența obiectelor de factură populară fac trecerea spre etsjul clădirii unde sunt expuse toate genurile de artă populară din principalele zone etnografice ale județului. Zona etnografică Humor se remarcă prin meșteșugul prelucrării artistice a lemnului care s-a materializat în obiecte de mare frumusețe ca formă și ornamentație, meșteșug practicat și astăzi cu aceeași măiestrie. Dintre țesături se remarcă ștergarele de perete și țesăturile de traistă în carouri. Costumele tradiționale purtate în toate anotimpurile oferă diferite variante artistice locale. Compuse din ștergar de cap cu vârste colorate, cămașă femeiască bogat ornamentată cu fir, paiete și mărgele, catrință sobră cu dungi înguste de culoare galben auriu și bondiță ornamentată cu șnur negru. Zona Dornelor se distinge prin velnițile de pat cu decor liniar, în culoarea naturală a lânii; ștergarele de perete cu motive geometrice realizate în tehnica alesăturii cu acul. O piesă de port deosebită este cămașa cu platcă cu motive vegetale aplicate cu mărgele. Cele patru ansambluri de port tradițional încadrează mai bine de un secol de conciliere a influențelor vechilor tradiții de natură geometrică specifică nordului Moldovei cu stilizări vegetale de influență năsăudeană. Salbele de dotă realizate cu ajutorul unei zgarde cu ornamente de mărgele, de care se prind monedele reprezintă o particuleritate zonală ce completează costumul femeiesc. Zona etnografică Rădăuți se caracterizează printr-o realiazre artistică superioară în toate domeniile creației populare. Se remarcă scoarțele, lăicerele și grindărașele cu motive geometrice și colorit de natură vegetală în general. Costumele populare ilustrează toate tipurile de haine tradiționale purtate de locuitorii acestor așezări. Zona Rădăuți se impune, de asemenea, prin meșteșugul cojocăritului reprezentat prin cele câteva tipuri de haine de blană (cojocel, pieptar, pieptar cu poale) cu o ornamentație bogată ce le subliniază croiala, într-un colorit viu cu motive vegetale. Meșteșugul olăritului este reprezentat prin ceramica neagră de Marginea și cea smălțuită de Rădăuți. Zona etnografică Câmpulung continuă străvechea tradiție a prelucrării lemnului prin realizarea diferitelor obiecte, de la furca de tors la cofița pentru aghiasmă și tiparul de prescure.

The new permanent exhibition of the History Museum was inaugurated on July 31, 2016, in the same location on the first floor, as the previous exhibition. The new presentation is based on local history, reflected in the many archaeological discoveries made over time, but also in the many events that had as their central place the current territory of Suceava County.

The most recent open air museum of Romania emerged during the eighth decade of the last century, when the Bukovina village had numerous monuments of folk architecture, but unfortunately, the activity - consisting in transferring several monuments and reconstructing three of them - was interrupted. After 1990, new homesteads and technical installations were moved on the plateau of the city, as 30 monuments folk architecture were reconstructed and put on display. Designed as a traditional Bukovina village, the open air exhibition will comprise 80 monuments of folk architecture: a church, a school, homesteads, workshops, technical installations, a public house. Monuments of folk architecture from the whole Bukovina are reconstructed on six hectares. Vama Church, monument of architecture, dates from 1783. The building is richly adorned with zoomorphic motifs (horse head) and geometric ones (rosette). The church is a classical triconch plan, and the original painting is extant only in the area of the altar. The bell tower was reconstructed next to the church. Dorna Cândreni House, built by late 18th century, at the time encountered rather frequently, is nowadays a unique piece from the area. The house is fitted with objects specific of Dorna area and an inventory including artefacts used by men for forestry and rafting. Roșu House, built by late 19th century, is representative for the Dorna area. The large building belonged to well off villagers, which is obvious from the two kilns with town like elements and the wide pavilion at the entrance. The public house of Moș Iordache dates from 1928 - 1930, and functioned as a public house in the village of Șaru Dornei until after World War II. On a small water course named \"Pârâul Morii\" a mill with hydraulic wheel is reconstructed. The stone mill from Humor Monastery, dating from late 19th century, used to be the largest mill in this area. Straja homestead, dating from the middle of the 19th century, typical of the transition area from mountain to plateau, comprises a dwelling house, stables and a pantry. Ostra House, dating from the second half of the 18th century, monumental due to proportions and sizes, has preserved a traditional construction plan widespread in Bukovina.","Contact person":"Violeta Marianciuc","County":"Suceava","Director":"Constantin Emil Ursu","E-mail address":["contact@muzeulbucovinei.ro","etnosv@yahoo.com"],"Founded":"1995","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"National","Locality":"Suceava","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"6968505","Name":"Museum of Bukovina.

Din chiar momentul inaugurării, muzeul și-a definit funcțiile sale moderne: conservativ-patrimonială și instructiv-educațională. Apoi, muzeul s-a dezvoltat sub semnul vremurilor și împrejurărilor pe care acestea le-au impus, înregistrând o continuitate firească, manifestată în preocuparea pentru creșterea patrimoniului, pentru îmbunătățirea mijloacelor de expunere și evidență, pentru cunoașterea fenomenelor pe care el le ilustra. După 1990, Corneliu Bucur, cu un colectiv restrâns de specialiști, a reușit să întrerupă îndelungatul exil al patrimoniului etnografic românesc, organizând Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" ca un important segment al memoriei și biografiei naționale. O condiție indispensabilă pentru înțelegerea oportunității conceperii proiectului tematic al Muzeului Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" ca muzeu interdisciplinar și plurietnic și înțelegerea mecanismelor producerii interferențelor culturale, în condițiile conviețuirii lor multiseculare, a constat din schimbarea paradigmei muzeale. Dintr-un muzeu etnografic clasic, cu expuneri de serii de obiecte, muzeul modern trebuie conceput ca un muzeu de istorie a civilizației, accentul trecând dinspre factologic spre fenomenologic, spre relaționarea și conexiunea proceselor etnoculturale. Vizitatorul este invitat să caute și să descopere chipul unui țăran complet, ce știe \"mersul stelelor\" dar și \"mersul lumii\". Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" este, în primul rând, trezorierul valorilor patrimoniale moștenite de la Muzeul \"Asociațiunii\" și recuperate după 1950. În registrele inventar există 9 002 obiecte înregistrate sub sigla \"A\", împărțite pe șase colecții: 6 523 broderii, 1 025 port-textile, 567 obiecte de cult, 539 lemn, os, fier, 330 ceramică și 18 păpuși. Colecțiile s-au îmbogățit, în ultima jumătate de secol, ajungând astăzi la 46 314 obiecte din care: 21 638 port-textile, 9 868 broderii, 7 137 ceramică, 3 938 obiecte de cult, 3 733 lemn, os, fier. Colecția de port are o însemnătate deosebită în structura organizatorică a patrimoniului, nu numai numeric, ci mai ales prin faptul că sunt reflectate, destul de echilibrat, toate zonele etnografice ale țării, oferindu-ne posibilitatea de a obține o imagine clară a costumului românesc tradițional. Din punct de vedere tipologic colecția cuprinde cămăși femeiești și bărbătești, poale, cătrințe, fote, vâlnice, pantaloni, acoperăminte de cap, haine de blană și dimie dar și încălțăminte. Nu lipsesc nici accesoriile vestimentare, impresionante podoabe realizate cu mărgele sau turnate în metal. Mai mult de 870 de piese sunt cămăși femeiești reprezentative pentru întregul teritoriu al României. Aproximativ 642 dintre acestea provin din spațiul transilvan, iar 469 aparțin, din punct de vedere etnografic, Zonei Sibiului și sudului Transilvaniei. 102 ii (dintre care: 2 ii de fetiță, 3 ii de mireasă, 6 ii cu poale) sunt reprezentative pentru localitățile care întregesc subzona etnografică Mărginimea Sibiului. Păpușile erau, la începutul secolului trecut, o modalitate specifică pentru etalarea costumelor populare, \"exponatul rege\" al majorității expozițiilor etnografice. Asociate temelor legate de port dar și de industrie de casă - păpușile au beneficiat de o mare popularitate, dezvoltându-se o adevărată tehnică de confecționarea a păpușilor - suporturi în expoziție. Textilele de interior reprezintă toate zonele etnografice ale țării. Numărul mare al acestora se explică și prin frecvența lor în gospodăria tradițională, fie cu funcție utilitară, fie cu funcție decorativă. Colecția de obiecte de artă religioasă țărănească cuprinde icoane pictate pe lemn și sticlă, cruci, pristolnice, xilogravuri, odoare bisericești. Icoanele aflate în colecția muzeului, pictate pe suport de lemn sau de sticlă, respectă temele iconografice bizantine, deși, uneori, maniera de interpretare este creativă. Principalele centre de iconari reprezentate în colecțiile muzeului sunt cele de la Nicula și Gherla - Cluj, Laz și Lancrăm - Alba, Șcheii Brașovului și Făgăraș - Brașov, Mărginimea Sibiului și Sibiu. În colecția muzeului se află icoane realizate atât de Savu Moga din Arpaș cât și de Matei Purcăriu Țâmforea din Cârțișoara. Colecția de lemn, mobilier și feronerie este și ea reprezentativă pentru întregul spațiu românesc. Nu lipsesc lăzile de zestre decorate prin incizie, crestare sau pictare. Blidarele, dulapurile pentru vase sau alimente (podișoare și armăroaie) reprezintă o grupă de mobilier cu utilitate înrudită și cu o mare varietate a formelor și ornamentelor. Nu lipsesc mesele de la cele rotunde sau dreptunghiulare, cu patru sau trei picioare, joase, până la impresionantele mese cu sertare pictate din Mărginimea Sibiului, după modelul săsesc. Colecția cuprinde și unelte destinate diferitelor ocupații tradiționale - pluguri de lemn, juguri, părți din mijloace de transport, tiocuri pentru gresia de ascuțit coasa, șei, harnașamente. Un segment de patrimoniu, deosebit de important, este alcătuit de obiectele de ceramică. Colecția s-a îmbogățit treptat ajungând astăzi să cuprindă piese reprezentative pentru multe dintre centrele de olari dispărute de pe harta etnografică a țării. Piesele existente în colecție au fost realizate în tehnici diferite: modelare cu mâna, modelare cu roata, modelare prin presare în tipare. Regăsim în colecție ceramică \"cu brâie\" din Biniș, Baia Mare, Oboga sau Curtea de Argeș; vase pictate înainte de ardere din Bihor și Banat; ceramică pictată cu cornul și pensula la Vlădești, Horezu, Leheceni, Târgu Lăpuș, Vama, Valea Izei, dar și ceramică imprimată cu \"rotița\" din Marginea, ceramică \"cu sigilii\" din Oboga și Româna, vase lustruite cu piatra din Marginea, Poiana Deleni și Săcel, ceramică angobată din Vlădești. Alături de acestea se află și inventarul atelierului de olar - roata pentru modelat, troaca, mezdreaua, cuțitoaia, cornul, gaița, râșnița etc. Patrimoniul muzeului cuprinde și importante piese ce alcătuiesc recuzita obiceiurilor din ciclul vieții sau a celor de peste an. Cea mai numeroasă categorie de obiecte o reprezintă ouăle încondeiate, ce vin să depună mărturie despre un meșteșug practicat cândva în toată țara. Aceste \"mici capodopere\" vorbesc despre măiestria și credința celor ce le-au creat. Cele mai interesante exemplare provin din nordul Moldovei și din zona Vrancei. În Colecția \"ASTRA\" întâlnim și ouăle încondeiate de Bran sau cele din zona Olteniei, deosebit de fastuoase prin simplitatea și noblețea armoniilor de roșu, galben, negru și alb. În paralel cu efortul expozițional, Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" a inițiat și aplicat, în baza teoriilor moderne, de reprezentare integrală a culturii populare tradiționale, în expresiile sale materiale și spirituale, conceptul modern de \"museum vivum\", prin dezvoltarea unui adevărat sistem național de cercetare, valorificare, consolidare, catalizare și transmitere, a manifestărilor circumscrise patrimoniului cultural intangibil. Întreg acest program a fost realizat în deplin consens cu Recomandările UNESCO din anii 1989 și 1999 privind încurajarea și stimularea prezervării active a valorilor culturii naționale, reprezentând tradițiile popoarelor lumii, începând cu meșteșugurile artistice tradiționale, adoptând sintagma UNESCO - \"Tezaure umane vii\". rezintă două expoziții permanente: Muzeul etnografic în aer liber și Monumente de arhitectură și tehnică populară. Muzeul etnografic în aer liber a debutat în 1963 ca un muzeu al \"tehnicii populare\". Împărțit în patru sectoare tematice expoziționale abordează întregul sistem ocupațional tradițional. A cumulat cea mai complexă colecție de monumente de arhitectură și tehnică populară din România și o vastă arhivă documentar-științifică și tehnică despre universul creației tehnice țărănești. Un sistem instrumental manual, de o varietate tipologică impresionantă, demonstrînd o continuitate de viață și de creația materială în această parte a Europei acoperă practic cvasitotalitatea ocupațiilor tradiționale. Categoria \"monumentelor de tehnică populară\" excelează prin marea varietate tematică aparținând \"instalațiilor de industrie populară\", având în finalul expoziției patru mari complexe de industrii țărănești (provenite din Oltenia, Muntenia și Transilvania), dar și printr-o cvasicompletitudine tipologică greu de regăsit într-un muzeu din afara României. Colecția mulinologică este un caz cu totul unic, cele 33 mori de cereale prezentând toate tipurile energetice de mori cunoscute în spațiul Euro-Asiei, ce demonstrează între altele caracterul agrarian al civilizației tradiționale a poporului român. Monumentele de arhitectură populară prezintă o diversitate a tipurilor regionale. Arta populară este prezentă, atât în decorarea interioarelor locuințelor, cât și în atelierele meșteșugărești, fie că e vorba de piese textile sau ceramice, din lemn sau din metal, din chihlimbar sau din sticlă, mobilier funcțional sau recuzită religioasă. Din 1990 s-a adăugat sectorul destinat monumentelor de utilitate publică. Patrimoniul muzeal cuprinde 143 monumente, conținând 346 construcții și peste 20.000 obiecte de inventar funcțional, fiind cel mai mare și mai bogat muzeu din România. Acest muzeu este în primul rând trezorierul valorilor patrimoniale moștenite de la Muzeul \"Asociațiunii\" (înființat în anul 1905 și desființat, prin dictat comunist, în 1950). Patrimoniul său (transferat în anul 1950 la Muzeul Brukenthal) a format temeiul viitorului Muzeu al Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\".","Contact person":"Olga Nicoleta Popa","County":"Sibiu","Director":"Mirela Crețu","E-mail address":["office@muzeulastra.ro","civilizatie.transilvana@muzeulastra.ro"],"Fax":["0269.202.411"],"Founded":"1993","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"National","Locality":"Sibiu","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"6966510","Name":"\"ASTRA\" Museum of Transylvanian Civilisation","Part of":"\"ASTRA\" National Museum Complex","Phone":["0269.202.400"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966510_08.jpg"],"Position":"Șef secție","Postal code":"550182","Time table":["No permanent exhibition"],"Website":["http://www.muzeulastra.ro/"]},{"Address":"Piața Mică nr. 21 (pentru corespondență: Piața Mică nr. 11)","Administrative subordination":"Sibiu County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d714\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-Saseasca-„Emil-Sigerus”-Sibiu","Collection(s)":"The \"Emil Sigerus\" Museum of Saxon Ethnography was established on the 1st of July 1997. Its heritage includes over 7,000 items from Transylvania from the 14th - 20th centuries.

Most pieces had belonged to the first Saxon museum, \"Karpatenmuseum\" (the Carpathian Museum), established in Sibiu. The museum heritage comprises three collections, costumes-textiles, pottery, wood-bone-iron, each of them including extremely valuable pieces, representative for the culture and civilization of the Transylvanian Saxons and especially for their contribution to the growth and enrichment of Romanian and world culture.

The archaeological excavations conducted in 1996 revealed that in the place of the current building there was a wooden house, dated on the basis of a coin from the reign of King Bela IV (1235-1270). The building was raised on a trapezoidal surface, with a pavement, two storeys and an attic. Both fronts, the one facing Piața Mică and the other one towards Piața Huet, with identical decoration, were restored by the end of 1997.

They asked for credits, public contributions and subscriptions, and in 1894 the building was ready. It is a construction bearing neo-Renaissance elements, designed by the Mediaș architect Franz Maetz. Although small-sized, it gives an impression of monumentality. It stands on three storeys (semi-basement, ground floor and upper floor and originally had 16 rooms. The building never housed any other institution but the museum. There never was any original collection, but a heterogeneous gathering of natural history items that lay the foundation for the subsequent great theme collections. Currently, the most important heritage divisions are the following: mineralogy, petrography, palaeontology, botany, zoology, documentary material (pictures, photographs, slides, documentary graphics). The entire project of the permanent exhibition inaugurated in December 2007 is meant to take into a good account the extent patrimony from a scientific, chronological and esthetical perspective. As elements of novelty in the fashion of presentation, there are the tri-dimensional displaying through the means of dioramas and the sounding and illumination systems suggesting a night and day cycle in each described environment, all conferring to the exhibition a dynamic atmosphere, inducing the visitor an empathic approach to the condition of an explorer. In the first part of the exhibition is presented a succinct evolution of the live world, from the simplest organisms to the birds, starting with the invertebrates populating the aquatic environment, in seas and oceans, as jellyfishes, worms, corals, shellfishes and continuing with insects, fishes and reptiles, some of them having a frightening appearance, some of them impressing through their shapes and colours. The presentation of the birds is introduced by the ratite species (the ostrich, nandu and emu), considered to be curiosities of nature. A special part is the one presenting the aquatic birds in a context that reproduces the Danube Delta environment, comprising features of fauna and vegetation as well. The vegetation aspect is illustrated through authentic wood elements as conserved tree trunks. Apart from this expositional space, a slide shore is showed, populated as it is with the species of birds that are characteristic for this particular environment. The middle sector of the exhibition shows aspects in the life of the birds, especially the ones living in trees, from the small species to the large, diurnal or nocturnal birds of prey. The temperate zone is illustrated through all landforms (from the plane to the alpine heights), each of them populated by their specific fauna and flora. It is the sector where a complete image of birds, mammals and invertebrates is to be seen. Among them there are carnivore animals as the wolf and fox, the bear being along them as well. The tropical forest is illustrated by the numerous parrots and exotic butterflies, which impress the viewer through their richness of colours and shapes. The features of the most exotic areas on Earth are shown through the abundance of floristic elements, the climatic conditions being favourable for the development of luxuriant vegetation. The artic zone presents a seal, an animal which is representative for this particular area; it is an item of a historical importance as well, being one of the oldest pieces in the Museum’s collections. There is also a Snowy Owl (Nyctea scandiaca), considered to be the largest and the strongest among the owl species. The last diorama of this sector illustrates the diversity of the Australian continent. As a consequence of its geographical isolation from the rest of the continents, Australian fauna contains an impressive variety of endemic animals, a large part of the amphibians presented in exhibition populating only the Australian continent. Among the exhibited species there are the Koala, Sugar Glider, Squirrel Glider, Lyrebird, other Australian birds and several species of insects, all meant to impress the viewer. The palaeontological items in the permanent exhibition are a good opportunity for a reconstitution attempt. It could seem odd today that the animals adapted for a cold climate, as the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros, had dwelled on hills around Sibiu. Their bonny remains are in the possession of the Museum through the effort of one of the founders of the Transylvanian Society for Natural Sciences. Flanking the flight of stairs, the Mineralogical Sector is arranged in accordance with aesthetic criteria, displaying native minerals as gold, copper, decorative stones, semi-precious stones, rough minerals and minerals discovered for the first time in Romania as tellurate, krenerite, rhodochrosite.","Contact person":"Rodica Ciobanu","County":"Sibiu","Director":"Dr. Alexandru Constantin Chituță","Fax":["0269.211.545"],"Founded":"1895","General profile":"Natural Sciences","Importance":"National","Locality":"Sibiu","Main profile":"Natural Sciences - Botanics, Zoology; Geology","Museum code":"6966504","Name":"Natural History Museum","Part of":"Brukenthal National Museum","Phone":["0369.101.782"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966504_10.jpg"],"Position":"Șef secție","Postal code":"550160","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d543\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istoria-Farmaciei-Sibiu","Museum code":"6966503","Name":"History of Pharmacy Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d545\u0026-Muzeul-de-Vanatoare-„August-von-Spiess”-Sibiu","Museum code":"6966505","Name":"\"August von Spiess\" Hunting Museum"}],"Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00 (summer)","10:00 - 16:00 (winter)","Monday: closed"],"Virtual tour":["http://www.sibiul.ro/sibiu-virtual-tour/muzeul-de-istorie-naturala_40.php"],"Website":["http://www.brukenthalmuseum.ro/"]},{"Address":"Piața Mică nr. 26","Administrative subordination":"Ministry of Culture","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d543\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istoria-Farmaciei-Sibiu","Collection(s)":"The building housing the museum is a historic monument dating from 1568, bearing many architectural elements specific of the period: vaulted spaces in the pavement and on the ground floor, an open loggia on the ground floor, decorated with stucco at the ceilings and period woodwork. Currently the museum spans the pavement of the building of 120 sq.m., currently owned by the institution. This space functioned as a pharmacy from 1600 onwards. It was one of the most famous Transylvanian pharmacies named \"La Ursul Negru\" (\"Black Bear’s\"). The original museum collection emerged between 1950 and 1951 following a Health Ministry decree regarding the gathering of all the pharmacy history vestiges from all the relevant institutions in the country at Brukenthal Museum. The artefacts come from 70 old pharmacies, pharmaceutical offices, medical institutions and private persons from 32 localities in the country. The collection has been stored for 20 years. Due to the size and diversity of the collection there are valuable testimonies on the evolution of pharmacy science and technology, generally, and on the evolution of medication and pharmaceutical practice for over three centuries. It comprises drugs, laboratory utensils, recipients, books and documents, documentary graphics.

Complexul Național Muzeal \"ASTRA\", prin amplitudinea cercetării și valorificării științifice, în context multicultural și interdisciplinar a patrimoniului ettnomuzeal pe care îl gestionează și a programelor de protecție și promovare a tezarului cultural imaterial - ca inițiator și lider național al programului \"Tezaure Umane Vii\" se prezintă ca o instituție culturală europeană modernă cu multiple contacte și programe de colaborare internațională. Infrastructura ultramodernă de relaționare interactivă cu publicul prin două sisteme info-terminale cu monitoare senzitive (două mici enciclopedii care acoperă tematic domeniile patrimoniului tehnic, civilizației populare românești și a celei transilvane, prin excelență multietnice și multiculturale, alături de prezentarea programelor culturale specifice și a diverselor forme de asociere în sensul conservării și transmiterii între generații a tradițiilor culturale ale meșteșugurilor și artei populare - cum este de pildă Academia Artelor Tradiționale din România ), un sistem mobil fără fir de ghidare electronică în limba română și alte 3 limbi de circulație internațională, pentru Muzeul în Aer Liber din Dumbrava Sibiului, activ din acest an, precum și puternica prezență pe Internet prin site-ul Internet al Complexului Muzeal Național \"ASTRA\" (www.muzeulastra.ro), site-ul dedicat Centenarului Muzeului \"ASTRA\", sărbătorit în anul 2005 (www.centenar.muzeulastra.ro), site-ul Muzeului de Etnografie Universală \"Franz Binder\" (www.franzbinder.sibiu.ro) și revista virtuală cu apariție lunară a complexului, adresată în special tineretului și vârstelor școlare - Muzeul ASTRA Jurnal (www.jurnal.muzeulastra.ro) alături de site-ul Fundației Muzeului \"ASTRA\", site-ul Studioului de film \"ASTRA\", precum și câteva pagini web dedicate diverselor programe culturale în derulare, conferă Complexului Național Muzeal \"ASTRA\" o alură dinamică. Muzeul Civilizației Populare Tradiționale \"Astra\", cu sediul în Calea Rășinarilor, organizat actualmente pe o suprafață de 100 ha, a fost inaugurat în 1967 și a funcționat sub titulatura de Muzeul Tehnicii Populare până în 1990, când succesiv prin re-orientarea către linia muzeului european modern, a devenit Muzeul Civilizației Populare din România, iar din 1992, Muzeul Civilizației Populare Tradiționale \"ASTRA\", iar din anul 2001, unitate muzeală de bază a C.N.M \"ASTRA\" . M.C.P.T \"ASTRA\" deține în patrimoniu 197 monumente de arhitectură populară și peste 22.000 de piese etnografice în inventarul patrimoniului mobil. Muzeul de Etnogfrafie Universală \"Franz Binder\", inaugurat în 1993, în sediul din Piața Mică, nr.11, primul muzeu din România de acest fel, dedicat studiului și valorificării în context european a unui prețios patrimoniu de etnografie non-europeană (3500 de piese etnografice provenind din Africa, Australia, Asia, America de Nord, Centrală și de Sud) cu o tematică diversă acoperită de cele două sectoare expoziționale (expoziția de bază: Din cultura și arta popoarelor lumii și sectorul expozițiilor temporare: Din creația artizanală a popoarelor lumii). Muzeul are în colecțiile sale piese antice egiptene de excepție, piese de tezaur aparținând culturilor indigene central africane, piese de artă populară și artizanat provenind din toate colțurile lumii, de un real rafinament artistic și de o mare diversitate tipologică. Muzeul Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" este depozitarul moștenirii culturale a Muzeului \"ASOCIAȚIUNII\", înființat în anul 1905 și cunoscut sub cognomenul de Muzeul \"ASTRA\", a cunoscut un parcurs istoric oarecum advers, fiind desființat în 1950 și patrimoniul mutat în depozitele Muzeului Brukenthal. După 1990, patrimoniul etnografic al secției de artă populară este transferat la Muzeul Civilizației Populare și este conceput noul proiect de Muzeu al Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\", prin care tematic sunt însușite preocupările pentru studiul și promovarea artei populare autentice românești și a celorlalte componente etnice aparținând multiculturalității specifice spațiului transilvănean și coordonează un complex program de asistență, protecție și promovare a ceea ce prin Programul \"Tezaure umane vii\" este definit conform unor tratate internaționale la care România este cosemnatar, patrimoniul imaterial. MCT \"ASTRA\" are în organizare sau co-organizare târgurile și alte manifestări specifice de peste an, dintre care cea mai importantă este \"Festivalul Național al Tradițiilor Populare\" . Actualmente colecțiile Muzeului Civilizației Transilvane \"ASTRA\" numără 36.629 piese etnografice. Muzeul De Etnografie și Artă Populară Săsească \"Emil Sigerus\", cu sediul în Piața Huet, nr.12, deține în patrimoniul său mai bine de 7000 de piese etnografice săsesți și ungurești, una din colecțiile cele mai valoroase fiind cea de cahle (plăci ceramice pentru sobe), valorificată în expoziția de bază \"Cahle transilvănene (sec. XV - XIX)\" . Existența acestui muzeu asigură cunoașterea și înțelegerea rolului ocupat de sașii transilvăneni în cultura românească și universală, în special în acest spațiu de confluentă a mai multor culturi, cum este Transilvania în general și Sibiul în special centru cultural săsesc, aflat chiar în inima uneia dintre cele trei zone de colonizare săsească). Muzeul \"Emil Sigerus\" a dezvoltat începând din 1997 un program complex de salvare, conservare și valorificare a patrimoniului mobil și imobil al culturii și civilizației tradiționale a sașilor transilvăneni. Manifestări culturale de anvergură națională și internațională sunt numeroase, se desfășoară anual în sezonul estival - turistic, în muzeul în aer liber din Dumbrava Sibiului. Târgul creatorilor populari din România este o manifestare cultural-națională (reunește anual, în luna august, de Sf. Maria cei mai valoroși creatori ai centrelor de veche tradiție meșteșugărească, reprezentând toate genurile artei populare: țesut, brodat, olărit, prelucrarea lemnului, osului, metalelor, confecționarea instrumentelor populare, muzicale, a măștilor, pictura pe lemn și sticlă, încondeierea ouălor). Olimpiada națională a copiilor \"meștesuguri artistice tradiționale\" este etapă națională în cadrul unui program de recuperare și revitalizare de către tineri, în contextul vieții contemporane, a creațiilor populare tradiționale, pentru dezvoltarea talentului acestora în sensul producerii unor valori autentice de artă populară tradițională,care are loc anual. La această olimpiadă participă copii cu vârsta cuprinsă între 6 și 18 ani,selecționați la fazele județene. Olimpiada este organizată împreună cu Ministerul Educației, Cercetării și Tineretului. Festivalul național al tradițiilor populare, organizat după modelul \"Smithsonian Folklife Festival\" Washington D.C., la care România a participat în vara anului 1999, reunește cei mai valoroși și reputați creatori de artă populară din toate domeniile culturii și civilizației populare. Aceștia provin din medii sociale și etnice diferite, din diverse regiuni și zone etnografice ale țării, selecția lor fiind făcută de specialiști în domeniu. La fiecare ediție a festivalului participă reprezentanții câte unui judet din Transilvania, Muntenia, Moldova si din Republica Moldova. Este conceput ca o manifestare spectaculară și interactivă, de prezentare scenică sau lucrativă, de dialog direct între meșteșugari și publicul vizitator. Cei aproximativ 350 de participanți asigură acoperirea celor 7 secțiuni tematice din programul festivalului: arte religioase (tradiții cultice legate de practicile religioase), literatura populară (basme, eresuri, poezie și teatru popular), arte muzicale (interpreți vocali și instrumentali), arte coregrafice (dans popular), arte plastice tradiționale (meșteșuguri artistice), arte mecanice (creație tehnică tradițională), arta culinară (meniuri după rețete tradiționale) pregătite și servite participanților și turiștilor.","Contact person":"Anda Ionaș","County":"Sibiu","Director":"Ciprian Angel Ștefan","E-mail address":["office@muzeulastra.com"],"Fax":["0269.218.060"],"Founded":"1963","General profile":"Ethnography","Historic Monument Building":"SB-II-m-B-12114","Importance":"National","Locality":"Sibiu","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"6966502","Name":"\"ASTRA\" National Museum Complex","Phone":["0269.218.195"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966502_06.jpg"],"Position":"Muzeograf PR","Postal code":"550182","Social media":["https://www.muzeulastra.com"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1661\u0026-Centrul-Cultural-Memorial-„Dr.-Gheorghe-Telea-Bologa”-Noul-Roman-Sibiu","Museum code":"6906505","Name":"\"Dr. Gheorghe Telea-Bologa\" Memorial Cultural Centre"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d549\u0026-Muzeul-Civilizatiei-Populare-Traditionale-ASTRA-Sibiu","Museum code":"69665022","Name":"\"ASTRA\" Museum of Traditional Folk Civilisation"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d715\u0026-Muzeul-Civilizatiei-Transilvane-„ASTRA”-Sibiu","Museum code":"6966510","Name":"\"ASTRA\" Museum of Transylvanian Civilisation"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d714\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-Saseasca-„Emil-Sigerus”-Sibiu","Museum code":"6966509","Name":"\"Emil Sigerus\" Museum of Saxon Ethnography and Folk Art"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d531\u0026-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-Universala-„Franz-Binder”-Sibiu","Museum code":"69665021","Name":"\"Franz Binder\" World Ethnography Museum"}],"Time table":["Monday - Friday: 10:00 - 18:00","Saturday, Sunday: 10:00 - 20:00 (summer)","9:00 - 17:00 (winter)"],"Virtual tour":["https://artsandculture.google.com/streetview/complexul-national-muzeal-astra/GQHNfYUDwIWQCg?sv_lng\u003d24.11541165222229\u0026sv_lat\u003d45.7551379425996\u0026sv_h\u003d-45.149\u0026sv_p\u003d0\u0026sv_pid\u003dGrhlwUC-MNMjnAolwfIaDg\u0026sv_z\u003d1.0000000000000002"],"Website":["http://www.muzeulastra.ro","http://www.muzeulastra.com"]},{"Address":"Strada Mitropoliei nr. 2","Administrative subordination":"Ministry of Culture","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d538\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-Sibiu-Sibiu","Collection(s)":"Clădirile care compun ansamblul Muzeului de Istorie reprezintă unul dintre cele mai impresionante monumente de arhitectură civilă gotică, cu elemente de Renaștere. Având inițial destinația de locuință, casa Altemberger-Pempflinger (sub forma unui turn-locuință), a fost cumpărată de Primăria orașului în anul 1549. De atunci aici va funcționa Primăria orașului, până în 1923, și Arhiva orașului și a comunității săsești din Transilvania până în 1948. Lucrările de restaurare ale monumentului s-au desfășurat cu intermitențe sub autoritatea Direcției Monumentelor Istorice între anii 1967-1988. S-a avut în vedere ca prin restaurare să se pună în valoare elementele specifice arhitecturii gotice, inclusiv refacerea etajului superior al turnului locuință, dar și modernizarea spațiilor, în perspectiva amenajării ca muzeu de istorie. În frontonul portalului de acces în clădire este încastrată o placă de marmură, cu un text care, în limba latină, menționează vizita făcută la Primărie de către împăratul Iosif al II-lea, în vara anului 1773. Adosat clădirii, cu acces la parter și etaj, se găsește un turn care a aparținut incintei a III-a de apărare a orașului. În curtea-grădină se găsește o elegantă loggie compusă din două travee. Începuturile colecțiilor muzeului aparțin perioadei de sfârșit al secolului XVIII, numeroase piese făcând parte din proprietatea fondatorului muzeului baronul Samuel von Brukenthal. Din colecțiile sale, în patrimoniul Muzeului de Istorie, sunt prezente obiecte din domeniul numismaticii, antichităților dacice și romane, precum și numeroase piese de o deosebită valoare, aparținând epocii medievale sau moderne. Dintre acestea menționăm: mecanisme aparținând diferitelor discipline ale științei și tehnicii, instrumente muzicale, obiecte ale artei decorative (podoabe de aur și argint), porțelanuri, sticlărie, textile, arme și produse de breaslă. După cel de-al doilea război mondial prin dizolvarea sau desființarea unor instituții culturale sibiene, patrimoniul muzeului s-a îmbogățit considerabil prin transferarea în muzeu a unor colecții existente în oraș (Societatea Carpatină, Camera de arme a orașului Sibiu, o parte a pieselor Muzeului Asociațiunii Astra) etc. În anul 1959, la Palatul Brukenthal, este deschisă Secția de Istorie, într-un spațiu destul de limitat în raport cu valoarea și diversitatea colecțiilor. În anul 1986, după încheierea lucrărilor de restaurare sunt deschise două expoziții, iar în luna mai 1988 este prezentat întregul circuit muzeal, după tematica obligatorie a muzeelor de istorie. În anii 1990-1992 tematica a fost complet și fundamental restructurată, insistându-se asupra particularităților istorice ale zonei. Pe parcursul circuitului expozițional permanent și în depozite sunt obiecte care ilustrează următoarele domenii: istoria străveche și veche, istoria medievală, ambele având și lapidariu, istoria modernă, apoi domeniul artelor decorative, textile (costume de epocă), produse ale diferitelor bresle sibiene, arme și armuri, feronerie, sticlărie, numismatică, bancnote, medalii și decorații românești și străine etc. Circuitul expozițional permanent cuprinde următoarele colecții: arheologie preistorică și istorie veche - 8.177 piese, colecția de obiecte medievale - 9.669 piese (arheologie medievală - 647 piese, produse de breaslă - 1.690 piese, produse textile - 1.500 piese, obiecte din domeniul științei și tehnicii - 90 piese, arme și armuri - 1.880 piese, decorații și medalii onorifice - 239 piese, produse din sticlă și faianță - 979 piese, sigilii, ștampile, matrițe, medalii și monede - 2.374 piese), colecția Tezaur - 63.435 piese, fondul de carte și periodice Carl Engber - 15.410 piese, colecția de clișee Emil Fischer - 8.050 piese, colecția de grafică documentară - 33.252 piese, colecția de istorie modernă și contemporană - 2.227 piese.","Contact person":"Cornel Lungu","County":"Sibiu","Director":"Dr. Alexandru Constantin Chituță","Fax":["0269.211.545"],"Founded":"1959","General profile":"History","Historic Monument Building":"SB-II-m-A-12134","Importance":"National","Locality":"Sibiu","Main profile":"Roman Archaeology, History, Numismatics","Museum code":"6966501","Name":"History Museum","Part of":"Brukenthal National Museum","Phone":["0269.218.143"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6966501_05.jpg"],"Position":"Director","Postal code":"550179","Time table":["Wednesday - Sunday: 10:00-18:00","Monday, Tuesday: close"],"Website":["http://www.brukenthalmuseum.ro/"]},{"Accreditation":["O.M.C.C.

Its collections were established by Baron Samuel von Brukenthal (1721 - 1803), governor of Transylvania between 1777 and 1787. The museum could receive visitors as early as in 1790, three years before Louvre Museum opened. The official opening took place in 1817. Thus, it is the oldest museum in this country. The museum received also the collections of the Carpathian Society Museum. In 1950 497 Romanian works of art from the former Astra Museum were added. The museum comprises: Brukenthal Palace, the Museum of History, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Pharmacy History, the \"August von Spiess\" Museum of Hunting, and the House of the Arts (the premises of the temporary contemporary art exhibitions), the Contemporary Art Galleries and the Blue House. The Art Gallery comprises the two permanent exhibitions, the Brukenthal Picture Gallery Collections, and the National Art Gallery, while on the second floor there are the halls for temporary exhibitions. Brukenthal Palace housing the museum is a Baroque monument, built by Baron Samuel von Brukenthal. The main wing was built between 1778 and 1788. Sculptor Sino Hoffmeyer worked at it. The Brukenthal Picture Gallery, whose exhibits were purchased by the baron in Vienna, after 1750, holds and illustrates the Flemish-Dutch painting school (450 items), the Italian one (200 items), the German-Austrian one (480), the French and Spanish ones (20) from the 15th - 18th centuries. The National Art Gallery, whose collections were gathered after 1950, from the ASTRA collections and the acquisitions made in time, comprises reference works, illustrating the history of Romanian art from the 15th - 20th centuries, including over 3,000 items. The Stamp Room, founded by Baron Samuel von Brukenthal, is the oldest in this country. It holds sketchings from the 16th - 18th centuries, as well as modern and contemporary Romanian graphics, summing up over 12,000 items. The famous artists include Albrecht Dürer, Marcantonio Raimondi, Hendrick Goltzius, Agostino Carracci, J. Callot, G. Tiepolo, Piranesi.

Încercări de realizare a unui muzeu existaseră cu mult timp înainte. Astfel, în 1880 s-a constituit Asociația muzeistică din Sălaj și s-a înființat un muzeu în Zalău cu ajutorul despărțământului sălăjan al Astrei, muzeu care exista în 1926. În anul 1940 această instituție și-a încetat activitatea, iar urma pieselor s-a pierdut. În 1951 d-l Vasile Lucăcel primește funcția de director al instituției muzeale nou create, \u0026#238;n aceeași strada a Crinului nr.1, și începe activitatea de colecționare a pieselor și de organizare a expoziției de bază, care va fi vernisată în august 1952, iar în 1956 va fi refăcută și apoi extinsă, în 1965, prin organizarea în spațiul amintit, a secțiilor de artă populară și artă plastică. Clădirea actualului sediu i-a fost repartizată muzeului în 1969, când începe amenajarea unei noi expoziții de bază cu trei secții: istorie veche, artă populară și artă plastică. Noul muzeu își vernisează expozițiile în august 1971 și nu suferă modificări importante până în 1986. Spațiul muzeului se extinde treptat. Arta plastică este organizată într-un sediu nou, din strada Doja nr. 6, în fosta clădire a Băncii Naționale. Secția de artă se constituie în 1981, prin donația maestrului Ioan Sima, pictor născut în comuna Pericei din județul Sălaj, primind denumirea de Galeria de Artă. Până în 1985 spațiul de expunere se extinde prin construirea, în continuarea clădirii, a unor noi încăperi și organizarea expoziției de artă plastică contemporană. Printre colecțiile muzeului se numără obiecte din domeniile: arheologie (tezaurul de la Guruslău, vase ceramice din epoca bronzului, ceramică dacică de la Buciumi; piese din castrul roman de la Porolissum - Moigrad); istorie (unelte, arme, documente); etnografie și artă populară (textile și piese de port, sumane, pieptare, icoane); entomologie (lepidoptere și coleoptere); bibliotecă (9.000 volume). ----- The museum was established on the 1st of May 1951. It comprised just four rooms on the first floor of the building in 1 Crinului Street. Attempts at developing a museum had been made repeatedly. Thus, in 1880, the Museum Association in Sălaj emerged and a museum in Zalău was established with help from the Sălaj department of Astra, a museum that existed in 1926. In 1940 this institution ceased to function, and the exhibits were lost. In 1951, Mr. Vasile Lucăcel was appointed director of the new museum institution, located in 1 Crinului Street. The latter began to collect pieces and organize the permanent exhibition that opened in August 1952, and in 1956 was remade and extended, in 1965 the folk art and fine arts departments emerged in the space mentioned. The current building was given to the museum in 1969, when the new permanent exhibition emerged with three departments: ancient history, folk art and fine arts. The new museum opened its exhibitions in August 1971 and did not undergo important changes until 1986. The museum space has grew gradually. Fine arts moved to a new location, in 6 Doja Street, in the former building of the National Bank. The art department emerged in 1981, due to the donation from master Ioan Sima, a painter, born in the commune of Pericei in Sălaj county, and received the name of Art Gallery. Until 1985 the exhibition room extended by the construction, as a prolongation of the building, of new rooms and the emergence of a contemporary fine arts exhibition. The museum collections include exhibits representing the fields: archaeology (the Guruslău hoard, Bronze Age pottery, Dacian pottery from Buciumi; artefacts from the Roman camp of Porolissum - Moigrad); history: tools, weapons, documents; ethnography and folk art (textiles, costumes, thick long coats, shirt fronts, icons); entomology (Lepidoptera and Coleoptera); a library (9,000 vols.). The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.","County":"Sălaj","Director":"Corina Bejinariu","E-mail address":["muzeul.zalau@gmail.com"],"Fax":["0260.661.706"],"Founded":"1951","General profile":"Archaeology","Historic Monument Building":"SJ-II-m-B-05007","Importance":"County","Locality":"Zalău","Main profile":"Roman Archaeology","Museum code":"6964500","Name":"History and Art County Museum","Phone":["0260.612.223","0260.661.706"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6964500_01.jpg"],"Postal code":"450042","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2139\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Iuliu-Maniu”-Badacin-Salaj","Museum code":"6964510","Name":"”Iuliu Maniu” Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d528\u0026-Muzeul-Judetean-de-Istorie-si-Arta-Galeria-de-Arta-„Ioan-Sima”-Zalau-Salaj","Museum code":"6964501","Name":"History and Art County Museum. \"Ioan Sima\" Art Gallery"}],"Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 09:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"],"Website":["http://www.muzeuzalau.ro/"]},{"Address":"Strada Aurel Popp nr. 13","Administrative subordination":"Satu Mare County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d735\u0026-Atelier-Memorial-„Aurel-Popp”-Satu-Mare","Collection(s)":"The studio is housed in a building erected by the Romanian painter Aurel Popp (1879 - 1960), between 1934 and 1935, and functioned as his studio until his death in 1960.

The school functioned “in some old boyar’s houses, made available for this purpose by the Almasanu Bank, to which Cihodaru (the architect) has built, nearby, other headquarters.” (N. Iorga, “A human’s lifetime”). Inside that “new headquarters”, the dining hall and the weddings hall were installed. The building dates from the XIX century. The necessary funds were gathered due to a call launched in 1921 and to a subscriptions list. The young teachers, chosen from the best in all country’s regions and citizens (Romanians, Saxons and Hungarians) were trained in a new pedagogical, scientific and patriotic spirit for one year. Those missionaries were creating, in the rural areas, a new Romanian soul. Nowadays, the building hosts an exhibition of religious art which continues the idea of another cultural establishment - namely the Religious Art Museum, founded in 1923 by Nicolae Iorga at Valenii de Munte and left under the care of the Missionaries’ School. The exhibition includes, in its four halls, exhibits of outstanding value, beginning with wooden icons from the XVII - XIX centuries, silver and brass candleholders, wooden and metallic hand crucifixes, pectoral crucifixes, priestly garments (miter, felonion, sleeves, epitrachelion, epigonation, cingulum), chalice coverings dating from the XIX Century, gilded silver chalices, waist inkwells, old ecclesiastical books, wool carpets, kandilas. These objects were crafted in local workshops and are bearing Russian, Greek, occidental and oriental style influences. One room is dedicated to the local heritage - objects from the XVIII - XX centuries, such as: wooden icons, ecclesiastical books, chalices, worship pots, a monastery tabernacle. All these are property of the Valeni Monastery church and are kept in custody by the museum. BARSESTI: The museum is the property of Mr. Costică Beș, an autodidact man owning approx 370 objects. They are held in precarious conditions, in 3 small warehouses and an inner courtyard. In his collection work tools (looms, ploughs, coopers\u0027 tools), household objects, ceremonial objects (flasks and woven fabrics), parts of traditional clothes and musical instruments. There are, also, objects specific to a museum (photos, weapons, decorations/distinctions, documents) reflecting the local history in the period between the two World Wars. AVRAMIDE: The building is renovated; it presents aspects of the urban life of Tulcea town between the end of the XIX and beginning of the XX centuries. Carrying on this project aims at highlighting Tulcea identity within the Dobrogea regional one. Also, the complex is foreseen to have an interactive component, through diverse cultural and artistic activities intending to connect the past to the future. The complex, composed of the Avramide House and the Art Museum (in no.2, Grigore Antipa street), will exhibit: art (paintings and sculpture) with works of consecrated Romanian painters and, also, works by contemporary painters; painting and engraving workshops for children and amateurs; oriental art exhibition; Dobrogea art exhibition; art exhibition of the national minorities; small concerts, associated to important cultural events; cultural events. The museum (owned by Mr. Emil Kindlein) is atypically located - inside a shopping mall - and presents the history of watchmaker and jeweller craftsmanship of the early thirties. The exhibits belonged to the owner’s grandfather, Mr. Petru Kindlein, who recreated the workshop and the store. Also, the museum has a section where documents are exhibited, vintage photos and personal objects. It has a collection of more than 2000 watches, wooden miniatures by Bajko Attila and multimedia elements. Partners in the museum arrangement project were: Bega Shopping Center and Timisoara National Theatre.","County":"Prahova","Director":"Mihal Dumitrache","E-mail address":["muzeuliorgavaleni@yahoo.com"],"General profile":"Arts","Historic Monument Building":"PH-II-a-A-16842","Importance":"County","Locality":"Vălenii de Munte","Main profile":"Art","Museum code":"6961304","Name":"\u0027Nicolae Iorga\u0027 Religious Art Museum","Part of":"Prahova County Museum of History and Archaeology","Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6961304_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6961304_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6961304_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6961304_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6961304_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6961304_06.jpg"],"Postal code":"106400","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00","Monday closed"]},{"Access":"Near the Three Hierachs Church","Address":"Strada 23 August nr. 19","Administrative subordination":"Prahova County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d512\u0026-Muzeul-Sarii-Slanic-Prahova","Collection(s)":"\"Salt Museum\", hosted by Cămărășiei house, Strada 23 August no. 19, Slănic Prahova - historical and architectural monument from the 18th century, opened on August 30, 1978, and at that time it illustrated the formation of salt deposits and the fauna of the Slănic area.

Rainer\" - in Cheia, Museum \"The Nature of the Teleajen Valley\" - in Vălenii de Munte, Botanical Garden - in Bucov. The uniqueness of this museum among its institutions is its profoundly educational character, having a brand assumed as MUSEUM-SCHOOL through the educational offer for pupils and preschools, but also due to the interactive presentation of the permanent exhibitions using modern exposure techniques such as augmented reality and VR technology.

The museum also offers a virtual tour to those who cannot physically visit it. It is one of the nine sections of the Prahova County Museum of Natural Sciences, which was established on December 30, 1956. Although it has a long life, the Museum of Man has not aged at all. The idea of the presentation with modern museum technical means came in the context in which the repair and restoration works at the Palace of Culture building were completed. Then the permanent exhibition halls were rethought, highlighting the museum objects in the collections by means of new technologies. Since March 2013, the Museum of Man has moved from props and dioramas, long appreciated for their spectacularity and beauty, to VR technology and augmented reality, virtual presenter and interactive games. The journey therefore begins in the Hall of Anthropogenesis, where the formation of the Universe, the Milky Way Galaxy and the planets, as well as the appearance and evolution of life on Earth, are presented. In the Anatomy Room we are greeted by a virtual presenter in the form of a hologram, who presents her internal organs, structure and functions. In the Genetics Room, the visitor can travel imaginary inside the cell. The character chosen for the projection is the vinegar fly, which contributed to the development of some fundamental laws of genetics. The Biodiversity Hall is spectacular with over 200 exhibits: plants and animals, exotic and indigenous species, aquatic and terrestrial, both invertebrates and vertebrates. The Hall of Protected Areas presents the importance of conserving and protecting nature. The highlight of this room is the interactive floor, where visitors discover what can happen if man trespasses on a certain natural environment, how fish run away from him when he steps into the water. Nature SOS Hall compares sustainable exploitation and overexploitation, the two areas being separated by a projection of a waterfall continued with a river.Finally, we arrive at the Population Hall, where the diversity of the human species is presented.","County":"Prahova","Director":"Dragoș Grigorescu","E-mail address":["office@muzbioph.ro"],"Fax":["0244.511.970"],"Founded":"1956","General profile":"Natural Sciences","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Ploiești","Main profile":"Natural Sciences","Museum code":"6960519","Name":"\"Museum of Man\" Exhibition","Part of":"Prahova County Natural Sciences Museum","Phone":["0244.597.896"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960519_11.jpg"],"Postal code":"100066","Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00-17:00","Monday closed"],"Virtual tour":["https://my.matterport.com/show/?m\u003dXF4T3zGqcdd\u0026fbclid\u003dIwAR3w9lJD4y8f6dVfPmbrx6WtGNE4X_mCTmRYmK_iwCaHBRPlQByAXI0Ku-s"],"Website":["http://www.muzbioph.ro"]},{"Address":"Strada Berevoiești nr. 57","Administrative subordination":"Vălenii de Munte City Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1697\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Nicolae-Tonitza”-Valenii-de-Munte-Prahova","Collection(s)":"The Romanian painter Nicolae Tonitza (1921 - 1924) had his workshop in this house.","County":"Prahova","General profile":"Memorials","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Vălenii de Munte","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"6960516","Name":"\"Nicolae Tonitza\" Memorial House","Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960516_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960516_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960516_03.jpg"],"Postal code":"106400"},{"Access":"Tram 102, bus: 30, 1, 44 (Coreco)","Address":"Strada Nichita Stănescu nr. 1","Administrative subordination":"Prahova County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d732\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Nichita-Stanescu”-Ploiesti-Prahova","Collection(s)":"Inaugurat în casa natală, în ziua de 13 decembrie 2002, secție a Muzeului de Istorie și Arheologie Prahova, muzeul este o instituție de prezentare a „fenomenului Nichita” în spațiul în care s-a născut, a trăit anii copilăriei și adolescenței, s-a format ca om și poet.

Arhitectura ei simplă și echilibrată amintind de cea a caselor țărănești din satele de câmpie, arată că stăpânul trebuie să fi fost un om gospodar, cu simțul frumosului, știind a cântări cu măsură, dar fără zgârcenie fiecare lucru. Așezate în șir, încăperile sunt luminate de ferestre ce împart armonios orizontalitatea fațadei. Dormitorul în care a văzut lumina soarelui copilul Nini, camera de lucru a elevului, sufrageria și bucătăria sunt mobilate cu piese ce au aparținut familiei Stănescu.

A publicat numeroase lucrări privitoare la istoria popoarelor sud-est europene, asupra slavilor de apus și răsărit, a Imperiilor bizantin și otoman.

Nicolae Iorga a locuit și a creat la Vălenii de Munte între anii 1907 - 1940, în clădirea care a devenit muzeu, inaugurat la 28 noiembrie 1965. Atestată documentar in 1833, casa construită de polcovnicul Panca, este monument de arhitectură datând de la sfârșitul secolului al XVIII-lea, caracteristic zonei subcarpatice prahovene. Clădirea a fost restaurată în 1977. Casa a fost cumpărată, de Iorga, în 1908. Profesorul a construit două corpuri de clădire, B și C, astăzi spații muzeale. În spatele acestei clădiri se află o altă clădire, din secolul al XVIII-lea, \"Școala de misionare\", înființată în 1923 de Iorga, și care, în prezent, adăpostește Muzeul de Artă Religioasă.

The first editions, nearing the writer’s signature, of the volumes “Drama”, “Moments”, “New Sketches”, are on display next to the photographs, providing clues as to the writer’s friends. Further exhibits include the translations from the writer’s works in various languages, posters interpreting Caragiale’s comedies in the world: France, Japan, Spain, Italy and Belgium.

Orăscu, the author of the design for the University of Bucharest, the Academy bookshop, etc. Due to its artistic and historical relevance, the building is listed as a monument of architecture of Romania. From the laying of the foundation stone on the 31st of May 1865 and the finishing in 1867 to 1970, when it became the shelter of the Prahova museum, on its premises prestigious educational institutions conducted their activity, starting with the first Ploiești gymnasium - “St. Peter and Paul”, during the reign of Al. I. Cuza. The building was restored many times, and each intervention was undertaken considering the conservation of the original characteristics of the monument. The last restoration, of considerable size, took place between 1990 and 1995. On that occasion, while strictly observing the architectural personality of the monument, the building benefited from the consolidation and refurbishment required by the new outlook of the permanent Exhibition. The idea governing the theme reorganization of the permanent exhibition of the Prahova County Museum of History and Archaeology, was that of singling it out in the context of the relevant local institutions, by valorizing its own heritage, the studies and researches conducted by specialists in various fields (archaeology, mediaeval, modern and contemporary history, numismatics, medals, etc.). Until now out of the general themes of the museum we achieved, depending on the material means available, the stages illustrating the archaeological finds from the Prahova county - Târgșoru Vechi and Budureasca archaeological reservations, the beginnings of the Ploiești city, events from the middle of the 19th century (1848) and their echo in Prahova, the coin and medal rooms, aspects of the Prahova cultural life before the war. On the outside, the entranceway to the museum is framed by the statues of Saints Peter and Paul, patrons of the Gymnasium that operated there as early as 1868. In the courtyard facing the museum, for creating an evoking environment, they set the busts of the princes: Mircea the Old, Vlad Țepeș, Michael the Brave and Alexander John Cuza, great personalities of the national history, whose lives and works are closely related to the history of Ploiești and the Prahova region. In the inner courtyard of the museum the exhibits, part of a large Lapidarium, include Roman lithic artifacts, as well as commemorative monuments - the monumental cross from Urloi Valley (Urlați), mentioning the uprising of the soldiers from 1655. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.","County":"Prahova","Director":"Mihal Dumitrache","E-mail address":["office@histmuseumph.ro"],"Founded":"1953 -1955","General profile":"Archaeology","Historic Monument Building":"PH-II-m-A-16246","Importance":"County","Locality":"Ploiești","Main profile":"Roman Archaeology, History","Museum code":"6960500","Name":"Prahova County Museum of History and Archaeology","Phone":["0244.514.437","0244.522.656"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6960500_14.jpg"],"Postal code":"100042","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d501\u0026-Muzeul-„Casa-Domneasca”-Brebu-Prahova","Museum code":"6960510","Name":"\"Princely House\" Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1609\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Constantin-si-Ion-Stere”-Bucov-Prahova","Museum code":"51620000173","Name":"\"Constantin și Ion Stere\" Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d491\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Cezar-Petrescu”-Busteni-Prahova","Museum code":"6960505","Name":"\"Cezar Petrescu\" Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1734\u0026-Muzeul-„Conacul-Pana-Filipescu”-Filipestii-de-Targ-Prahova","Museum code":"6960520","Name":"\"Pană Filipescu\" Manor Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d493\u0026-Muzeul-„Casa-de-targovet-din-secolele-al-XVIII-lea-al-XIX-lea”-(Hagi-Prodan)-Ploiesti-Prahova","Museum code":"6960512","Name":"\"Hagi Prodan\" Urban House Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d492\u0026-Muzeul-„Ion-Luca-Caragiale”-Ploiesti-Prahova","Museum code":"6960503","Name":"\"Ion Luca Caragiale\" Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d496\u0026-Muzeul-Ceasului-„Nicolae-Simache”-Ploiesti-Prahova","Museum code":"6960501","Name":"\"Nicolae Simache\" Clock Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d732\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Nichita-Stanescu”-Ploiesti-Prahova","Museum code":"6960515","Name":"\"Nichita Stănescu\" Memorial Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d722\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Paul-Constantinescu”-Ploiesti-Prahova","Museum code":"6960514","Name":"\"Paul Constantinescu\" Memorial Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1610\u0026-Muzeul-satesc-Sangeru-Sangeru-Prahova","Museum code":"51620000174","Name":"Village Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d515\u0026-Rezervatia-Arheologica-„Targsoru-Vechi”-Targsoru-Vechi-Prahova","Museum code":"6960511","Name":"Târgșoru Vechi Archaeological Park"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1688\u0026-Expozitia-permanenta-„Tohani-Popas-pe-drumul-vinului”-Tohani-Prahova","Museum code":"6960507","Name":"\"Tohani -

On the 1st of May 1952 the Slatina District Museum was inaugurated. The collector Jack Florescu set in his own house two halls for presenting the collection. The archaeological excavations in the Sălcuța - Gumelnița Neolithic tells at Slatina (Strehareț), Brebeni and Drăgănești-Olt, in the settlement of Verbicioara at Donești (Vulturești), in the dava at Sprâncenata, in the camp and civil settlement of Acidava (Enoșești - Piatra Olt), at Chilia (the free Dacians), or in the settlement of Ipotești (Ipotești-Cândeș;ti-Ciurelu Culture) considerably enrich the initial collections. The archaeology collections stand proof of the occupation continuity and uninterrupted civilization on the lower Olt Valley by items illustrating the prehistorical or ancient material and spiritual culture: pottery, tools, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic statuettes; others prove the Geto-Dacian civilization, the Roman civilization in the area of the Alutan and trans-Alutan limes, the occupation continuity in the migrations age (two cultures of the same period were discovered in Olt: Chilia Culture and Ipotești Culture near Slatina-Cândești-Ciurelu), as well as the unbroken ties with the Byzantine Empire (the Byzantine silver coin hoard from the 7th century, digital fibulas and traditional Byzantine lamps). The Middle Ages reflects in a series of testimonies illustrating the links some princes had with Olt county: Vlad Vintilă, Michael the Brave, Matei Basarab and Constantine Brancovan; documents on great families, such as: Buzești, Brancovan, Deleanu, etc.; weapons; rare books; ornaments; numismatics - coins or coin hoards proving longstanding trade relations in an important customs place like Slatina (documented on the 20th of January 1368). The modern age comprises collections of documents, weapons, prints, period photographs, decorative art items and emphasizes the role of the urban settlement in the revival and national emancipation processes. The art department comprises works of contemporary painting and sculpture and focuses on creations of fine artists from Olt county.

Înființat în anul 1934 de către preotul Constantin Matasă, acest muzeu deține cea mai importantă colecție de ceramică eneolitică din Moldova (mil. IV-III î.Hr.). Alături de aceasta, în muzeu sunt tratate, în chip monografic, aspecte mai vechi (paleolitic și neolitic timpuriu) și mai noi (civilizația traco-geto-dacică din zonă, locuirea medievală, aspecte ale istoriei locale din epocile modernă și contemporană, activitatea muzeografică din județ ș.a.), din trecutul zonei. În primele opt săli sunt prezentate cele mai semnificative aspecte ale paleoliticului de pe Valea Bistriței și ale culturilor Starčevo-Criș, Precucuteni și Cucuteni, îmbinând expunerea de obiecte tridimensionale cu o ilustrație bogată și cu numeroase reconstituiri de complexe sau de procese ce făceau parte din inventarul de cunoștințe ale omului preistoric. Ultimei culturi amintite îi este rezervată cea mai mare parte a spațiului expozițional din primele opt săli ale expoziției permanente, raport cantitativ ce reflectă situația arheologică din teren (cel mai mare număr de situri cunoscute în zonă, printre care se remarcă cele de la Bodești-Cetățuia Frumușica, Izvoare, Traian, Ghelăiești, Târpești, Târgu Ocna-Podei, Poduri). În sălile 9-10 sunt expuse cele mai importante descoperiri ale epocii metalelor, reprezentată prin aspecte locale ale bronzului timpuriu și mijlociu (Lunca, Târpești) și prin culturile: Amforelor Sferice (materiale de la Bârgăoani, Mastacăn, Piatra-Șoimului, Piatra-Neamț), Costișa (piese din așezarea eponimă, de la Siliștea, Piatra-Șoimului, Poduri), Monteoru (Costișa și Traian) și Noua (ceramică, obiecte de piatră și de metal din așezările și necropolele de la Doina, Ciritei, Târpești, Davideni, Vânători-Neamț,). De la sfârșitul epocii bronzului și din prima epocă a fierului datează cea mai mare parte a pieselor de metal expuse în sala 10 și holul adiacent (depozitele de bronzuri de la Ruginoasa, Bozieni, Șerbești, pumnalele de tip akinakes de la Văratec, Găiceana și Petricani). Pentru Hallstatt-ul final și prima etapă a La-Tene-ului descoperirile de la Lunca și Vlădiceni documentează că aria de difuziune a aspectului cultural Canlia a inclus în secolele V-III î.Hr. și zona subcarpatică a Moldovei. În ceea ce privește civilizația dacică (prezentată în sălile 11-15) menționăm că muzeul din Piatra-Neamț a adus o contribuție deosebită la cercetarea stațiunilor din perioada clasică de la Bâtca Doamnei, Cozla și Calu (Piatra Șoimului) sau a celor daco-carpice de la Vlădiceni, Homiceni, Piatra-Neamț - Dărmănești și Lutărie, Cândești, Izvoare. În sala 16 sunt expuse materiale atribuite culturii tumulilor carpatici (de la Braniște și Nemțișor), culturii Sântana de Mureș-Cerneahov (de la Doina, și Izvoare, în special), precum și din segmentul istoric cuprins între secolele V-IX: prima parte a acestui interval este reprezentată în expoziție prin piese provenind din așezările Mănoaia, Costișa, Izvoare-Bahna, Târpești, Săbăoani, Borșeni și mai ales Davideni, (cea mai mare dintre comunitățile sătești din această perioadă documentate în spațiul est-carpatic) în timp ce pentru cea din urmă (sec. VIII-IX) cea mai mare parte a materialelor existente în colecția muzeului provin de la Brășăuți, Borniș, Izvoare-Bahna și Poiana-Dulcești. Ultima vitrină a sălii este rezervată pieselor provenind de la Piatra-Neamț-Bâtca Doamnei, unde în perioada evului mediu timpuriu a existat o tabără militară. Folosind mijloace de expunere specifice, sălile 17 și 19 ale muzeului înfățișează aspecte semnificative ale evoluției economice sociale și culturale a județului Neamț pe parcursul Evului Mediu, fiind consemnate evenimentele majore care s-au petrecut pe aceste meleaguri, la care localitățile ținutului Neamț s-au racordat. Printre exponatele cele mai importante din acest segment istoric se numără tezaurul de la Buruienești (conținând obiecte de podoabă, lingouri și monede medievale) și reconstituirea interiorului unei locuințe descoperite la Târgu-Neamț, datând din secolul al XIV-lea, cu o sobă cu cahle tip oală. Dezvoltarea economică, socială și culturală a comunităților rurale și urbane în secolele XIX-XX, cât și participarea locuitorilor județului la marile evenimente care s-au petrecut în acest timp sunt evidențiate în sălile 20-23, prin numeroase documente, fotografii, arme, medalii și obiecte de epocă. Circuitul expozițional se încheie cu sala 24, în care sunt etalate arme alb și de foc din secolele XIX și XX. Cabinetul numismatic, având două săli de expoziție, prezintă publicului vizitator monede antice și medievale, medalii, obiecte de podoabă de aur și argint, vase de metal. Din ultima categorie menționăm tezaurul de vase de aur de la Rădeni și vasele de argint din tezaurul de la Muncelul de Sus (jud. Iași). Alături de expoziția de bază, muzeul organizează numeroase expoziții temporare, sesiuni și colocvii cu caracter cultural-științific, întreprinde săpături arheologice pe care le valorifică prin publicații, se preocupă de ocrotirea patrimoniului ș.a.","Contact person":"Dr. Mihaela Cristina Verzea","County":"Neamț","Director":"Dr. Gheorghe Dumitroaia","E-mail address":["cmj@neamt.ro"],"Fax":["0233.217.496"],"Founded":"1934","General profile":"Archaeology","Historic Monument Building":"NT-II-m-B-10576","Importance":"National","Locality":"Piatra-Neamț","Main profile":"Archaeology","Museum code":"6956500","Name":"Neamț National Museum Complex","Phone":["0233.217.496","0233.218.108","0735.525.918 (Secretariat)"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_16.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_17.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6956500_18.jpg"],"Position":"Director Adjunct Științific","Postal code":"610029","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d467\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-National-Neamt-Muzeul-de-Istorie-Bicaz-Bicaz-Neamt","Museum code":"6956506","Name":"History and Ethnography Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d457\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-National-Neamt-Muzeul-Memorial-„Ion-Creanga“-Humulesti-Neamt","Museum code":"6956514","Name":"\"Ion Creangă\" Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d462\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-National-Neamt-Muzeul-de-Arta-Piatra-Neamt-Piatra-Neamt-Neamt","Museum code":"6956502","Name":"Art Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d464\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-National-Neamt-Muzeul-de-Etnografie-Piatra-Neamt-Piatra-Neamt-Neamt","Museum code":"6956503","Name":"Ethnographic Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2034\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-National-Neamt-Muzeul-de-Istorie-si-Arheologie-Piatra-Neamt-Neamt","Museum code":"6956501","Name":"Neamț National Museum -

Museology emerged at Târgu-Mureș by the end of the 19th century, when the Cultural and Economic Association of the Szeckler people was established. The first exhibition of the Museum of Industrial Art opened on the 27th of June 1886, and between 1890 and 1893 the building of the Szeckler Museum of Industrial Art was built (the current building of the Museum of Natural Sciences on 24 Horea Street). Having a great historic and documentary value, the collection of the Museum of Industrial Art was almost entirely lost during World War II. Only a small number of exhibits was included in the collection of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography, reopened in the Culture Palace, in 1949. Instead, the valuable pottery and faience collection was saved, and its pieces are today valuable property of the collection of the Transylvania History Museum in Cluj-Napoca. The foundations of a true museum were laid by Aurel Filimon, founder of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography in Târgu-Mureș, an encyclopedic personality, complex as an archaeologist and ethnographer, author of discoveries of great scientific value, that enrich the archaeological and ethnographic collections of the present museum. The permanent archaeological and ethnographic exhibition, organized in four halls on the second floor of the Culture Palace, opened in April 1934. Although the exhibition was closed down under the circumstances surrounding the 1940 - 1944 period, as the collections were stored, the museum continued its activity after the war, until 1957, when, due to a decision of the Regional Party Committee and the Regional City Hall, the building of the former museum of industrial art on 24 Horea Street was made available to the present museum, as there they opened the first exhibition of the Regional Museum in Târgu-Mureș. In 1964 the building listed as a historic monument in 11 Trandafirilor Square was taken over by the museum. There the Department of Modern and Contemporary History of the present County Museum was organized. In 1984 the permanent exhibition of ethnography and folk art reopened, located in 11 Trandafirilor Square, and in 1988 that of natural sciences, in the building in 24 Horea Street. Therefore, by the end of the 8th decade of the 20th century, the Mureș County Museum had become a true museum complex, as four departments and a conservation -restoration laboratory functioned. An important moment in the life of the Mureș County Museum was the 1979 - 1980 period, when the two exhibitions, the archaeology one and the modern and contemporary history one merged and were brought into the Culture Palace. That date can be considered the birth certificate of the Museum of Archaeology and History, found in the structure of the Mureș County Museum. The exhibition room extended on three floors of the left wing of the Culture Palace, as the exhibition comprises themes on the history of the county and the ethnic groups living there, from ancient times to the present day. Currently, that department has changed its premises. The History Museum has a heritage counting about 57,000 pieces, including collections of: decorative art, documents, history, medals and plaques, decorations, coins, science and technology. The exhibition activity was conducted due to temporary exhibitions that valorized the museum collections regarding the development of the city of Târgu-Mureș. The new History Museum exhibition will bear the title of Museum of Mureș Culture and Civilization. The exhibits and the adequate intuitive material will aim at representing all the ethnic groups living together in Mureș land: Romanians, Hungarians, Germans, Jews, etc, since the Middle Ages to the contemporary period. The exhibition will be structured by two large segments: the economic one and the cultural one.","County":"Mureș","Director":"Ötvös Koppány","Fax":["0365.430.021"],"Founded":"1886","General profile":"History","Importance":"County","Locality":"Târgu Mureș","Main profile":"History","Museum code":"6954500","Name":"Mureș County Museum","Phone":["0365.430.021"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6954500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6954500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6954500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6954500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6954500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6954500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6954500_07.jpg"],"Postal code":"540328","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d443\u0026-Galeria-de-Arta-„Ion-Vlasiu”-Targu-Mures-Mures","Museum code":"7055501","Name":"\"Ion Vlasiu\" Art Gallery"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1670\u0026-Galeria-de-Arta-„Nagy-Imre”-Targu-Mures-Mures","Museum code":"7055502","Name":"\"Nagy Imre\" Art Gallery"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d446\u0026-Muzeul-Judetean-Mures-Muzeul-de-Arta-Targu-Mures-Mures","Museum code":"7055500","Name":"Mureș County Museum.

After 1945, the museum grew in importance and developed its research area, as the Museum of the Iron Gates Region. On the 15th of May 1972 the museum opened under the present display having two departments: history and natural sciences with an aquarium presenting Danubian fish species. Later on ethnography and art departments emerged. The exhibits illustrate the fields: natural sciences (fauna and flora, an aquarium for the Danubian fauna and exotic fish), history, documents, archaeology (including prehistoric finds from Schela Cladovei, Roman finds from Drobeta and lapidarium), numismatics, ethnography (costumes, pottery, textiles from Mehedinți and the Iron Gate areas), Romanian fine arts (many works, even masterpieces, signed by great painters, such as Luchian, Petrașcu, Pallady, Tonitza, Dimitrescu, Șirato, Stoenescu, Iser, Ressu). The history - archaeology department comprises nine halls: Prehistory - the vestiges of the material and spiritual life of the Schela Cladovei culture, the Geto-Dacian Civilization, the Daco-Roman Wars, Roman Ancient Monuments (the bridge at Drobeta from the years 103 - 105), Mediaeval History, the Modern Age, Romanian Feudal Art and the Contemporary Age. The natural sciences exhibition, inaugurated on the 15th of May 1972, presents the physical and geographical conditions of the Iron Gates Gorge, (Hall 1), the flora and fauna of the Iron Gates Gorge (Hall 2), the Danubian ichtyofauna of the Iron Gates storage basin (aquarium), and the water fauna in the Iron Gates region. The exhibition closes with aspects relating to cosmogony, paleontological evidence, testimonies regarding the origin and evolution of man. The ethnography and folk art department holds a precious rich heritage, bearing documentary value. The exhibition presents first of all aspects on the rural civilization in the Iron Gates region. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.

On August 31, 1899, due historian Schönherr Gyula’s approaches, the Colony Museum Association was established, whose intense activity for the opening to the public of Baia Mare City Museum were successful on June 19, 1904. Since its inception, the museum has rich collections mainly by donations, especially for archaeology, coins, medals and old weapons etc. Thus, in 1901 the collection was made up of 2,441 pieces, in 1904 6,938 pieces, and on the eve of World War I, the number of objects reached 11,489. In the interwar period, Baia Mare reorganized its museum collections, the first exhibition being opened in 1924. In 1951 Baia Mare Museum became regional museum, and in the period from 1968 to 2006 functioned under the name of Maramureș County Museum with five sections: history and archaeology, art, ethnography and folk art, natural sciences, and history of art. ♦ Today, the County Museum of History and Archaeology of Maramureș is a public cultural institution subordinated to Maramureș County Council, which provides the necessary resources to achieve objectives for the basic functions of the museum. Following Decision no. 80 of 19th of September, 2006 of Maramureș County Council, County Museum of History and Archaeology was established on the 1st of October, 2006, based on History and Archaeology departments. Besides the Mint, built during the 18th century, the museum also manages an important historical monument, which was part of the fortification system of the medieval town of Baia Mare, Butchers’ Bastion. It was played back in the local community and tourist circuit in 2011 due to restoration and revitalization project Butchers Bastion in Baia Mare, Maramureș, implemented by the Maramureș County Council. Museum heritage, consisting of various categories of cultural goods, some of which are beyond local, regional and even national importance, is highlighted in the generous spaces of the former Mint of the city, and Butchers’ Bastion. Statistically, it sums up a number of 75,509 inventory numbers, of which archaeological heritage - 35,745 artefacts, and history heritage - 24,128 pieces consisting of collections of medieval archaeology, hoards, guilds, weapons and firearms, seals and patterns, prints and photographs, documents, technical mining, and memorial goods, 9,278 volume (16th - 20th century) rare books and documents. The museum library has 10,322 volumes. The archaeological heritage comes from systematic and preventive archaeological excavations, but also because of incidental findings, drawing on lines of human evolution over a long period of time. Some of the artefacts are showed in the permanent exhibition \"Treasures of the Bronze Age in northern Transylvania.\" Another important segment is the monetary treasures, pieces of lapidary, insignia and craft products, patterns and seals, weapons and firearms, prints and documents, however reconstitution enabling development dynamics of free Royal city Baia Mare. Mining has long been the economic base of the Baia Mare area, which makes it possible to reconstitute its evolution through the heritage museum comprising around 1,500 objects. Tools, ore means of transport, means of lighting underground, documents and photos can be found in the collection of mining history, many of them being rare or unique. Also included are parts preserved in situ of the first refining plant from Romania who worked in this area from 1926 to 1967, including the Treasury, where they kept the gold and silver bars before reaching the vaults of the National Bank. All this can be seen in the permanent exhibition \"Mining and civilization in Maramureș\". A special attraction for the audience is the collection of clocks (about 300 pieces) some exceptional specimens of outstanding scientific and cultural values, presented in the permanent exhibition \"Journey into the world of watch\". From huge tower clock to small clocks and pocket, from wall clock contemporary to the French Revolution (1789) to watches of guards, all attract the curiosity of viewers, fascinated by the sumptuous decoration characteristic to rococo style of some wall or pedestal clocks, as well as painted with enamel floral and talent of the craftsmen of yore.

The core of the museum was established as early as in 1955, upon the initiative of a lively group of Iași teachers and engineers, including academician Cristofor Simionescu, engineer Marcel Itcovici and Professor Ioan Curievici, who was deeply involved in the activity of the Museum, as he searched and found new sources of enriching the heritage, increasing the collections of great scientific and documentary value. The first department of the Museum was “Energetics”, opened the 1st March 1961 and reorganized in 1980. Today it presents to the visitors, the main forms of energy used by mankind over the centuries and marks by graphic panels and original exhibits the exceptional contributions of Romanian and world personalities in developing the energy field. An important moment in the evolution of the Museum was the organization and opening in February 1966 of the department “Sound Recording and Rendering”. The growth of the collection, in the following years, by new valuable exhibits, as well as the interest shown by visitors for the exhibition mentioned are the reasons for the its reorganization and expansion in a triple space, inaugurated in 1972. As a unique collection in this country, the “Sound Recording and Rendering” department chronologically presents the evolution of sound recording and rendering, from the cylinder to the shifts of the magnetic tape. Over the years, following the scientific investigation conducted by a team of specialists from the Museum, as well as the endeavours of finding and purchasing the heritage, we opened new museum departments, such as: “Telecommunications” (1984), “Poni-Cernătescu” Memorial Museum (1991), “Mineralogy-Crystallography” (1997) and “Computers” (2004). The “Telecommunications” department presents to the visitors a series of original exhibits illustrating the historical evolution of the remote data transmission systems and has four theme sectors: telegraphy, telephony, radio, television. One of the most recent departments, “Mineralogy-Crystallography”, shelters an original “mine flowers” collection, donated by Mr Constantine Gruescu, from Ocna de Fier (Caraș-Severin county) and comprises 126 samples representing polymetal ores, iron oxides and hydroxides (hematite, magnetite, limonite), as well as quartz varieties (from the rock quartz to the Japanese macle). The most recent department is entitled “Computers” and illustrates mainly their evolution over the second half of the 20th century.

La Slobozia s-a stabilit sediul administrativ al Muzeului Județean Ialomița cu cele două secții: Secția de etnografie - la Slobozia - și Secția de arheologie - la Călărași. Prin noua organizare administrativ-teritorială din anul 1981 s-au înființat județele Ialomița și Călărași. Astfel, Secția de arheologie de la Călărași s-a constituit în Muzeul Județean Călărași, astăzi Muzeul Dunării de Jos. Muzeul Județean Ialomița s-a constituit, la acea dată, din Secția de etnografie de la Slobozia. Profilul expozițional și științific al muzeului este pluridisciplinar: arheologic, istoric, etnografic, cultural, religios. Muzeul județean este organizat în trei secții aflate în localități diferite. La Slobozia se află Secția de etnografie, care găzduiește alături de expoziția etnografică de bază a muzeului, o sală de expoziții temporare, destinată descoperirilor arheologice și expoziția \"Mărturii de credință ortodoxă\", vernisată în anul 1990. Spațiul de expoziții temporare, din incinta Centrului Cultural \"Ionel Perlea\" găzduiește în prezent o expoziție de ceramică și scoarță românească, din colecțiile Muzeului Județean Ialomița.

Here, personal objects of the poet and his family can be admired, these being donated by Mitzura Arghezi, the poet\u0027s daughter, who comes every year to visit the museum, on the occasion of the International Tudor Festival Arghezi. Tudor Arghezi was born on May 21, 1880, in Bucharest, according to his own confession, \"through a circumstance of overtaking from Olten\" and died on July 14, 1967, being \"our greatest poet since Eminescu\", as literary critics would declare him at his editorial debut. The poet\u0027s father, Nae Theodorescu, born in Craiova, worked in the fields, and the poet\u0027s paternal grandfather, Tudor Cojocaru, who lived 113 years, was born in Cărbunești, Gorj , a locality he left as a young man and lived in Craiova. Tudor Cojocaru, inspired by his birthplace, changed his name, becoming Theodor Cărbunescu. Tudor Arghezi is the pseudonym of Ion N. Theodorescu, the poet borrowing his grandfather\u0027s first name, and he took the name, as he later testified, from the old name of the Argeș river- Argesis. \"I took my name to get out of anonymity,\" confessed the master, \"to distinguish myself from the crowd of Theodores.\" According to Mitzura Arghezi, she was looking for a name that would \"squeal\". The pseudonym chosen around 1900 became an official name only on May 9, 1956. The poet always considered himself to be from Oltenia and was connected to Olteni and Oltenia, as his daughter says, through everything he wrote and felt and he was proud of his Gorje roots. His internment in the camp at Târgu Jiu, in 1943, as a consequence of the anti-German pamphlet \"Baroane\", brought him even closer to the environment to which he felt attached to such an extent that he ordered it like the stone on the grave of himself and his wife, from Mărțișor, to have the mention \"originating in Gorj\".

The institution was among the first museums in the country and has its origins in the historical concerns of its founder, the founder Alexandru Ștefulescu (1856-1910), who in 1893 founded a historical and archaeological collection of the boys\u0027 primary school in Targu- Jiu, where he worked as a teacher and director. Passionate about history, about the past of this county, rightly called historic and picturesque, Alexandru Ștefulescu gathered around him people of culture, who helped and supported him in his initiatives, such as professor Iuliu Moisil, engineer Aurel Diaconovici and plastic artist Vitold Rola Piekarski. His private collections were added to the Ștefulescu collection, which actually constituted the core of the museum. \"Today, July 16, 1894, this museum was founded, says the act of incorporation, in which all those who value our Romanian nation, the historical, ethnographic, flora, fauna and prehistoric past of the Gorju will find it.\" With the beginning of the 20th century, the group of the main animators of the museum broke up, in 1910 Alexandru Ștefulescu died. The museum did not disappear, but the years of the war endangered its existence, with part of the collection being alienated or destroyed. After the war, the remaining historical pieces will be reorganized in an exhibition at the Tudor Vladimirescu High School. In 1925, on the initiative of the Gorj Women\u0027s League and its president Aretia Tatarescu, a fund-raising campaign was opened for the construction of a building intended for the museum, a project entrusted to the architect Iulius Doppelreiter, drawn up according to the architecture of the Crăsnaru tower in Groterea Gorj and erected in the Public Garden of the city of Târgu-Jiu. The new museum will be inaugurated on September 5, 1926 and will function here until 1954, when due to insufficient space for the collections, the museum moved to a nationalized building (lawyer Bicescu\u0027s houses) on Tudor Vladimirescu street, no. 73. Towards the end of 1974, a new building was found for the museum, to house its increasingly numerous collection, namely that of the former Administrative Palace in Griviței str. (today Geneva) no. 8, the place where it had debuted as an institution in 1894 . Since 1975, the new exhibition of history and archeology as well as one of plastic arts has been reorganized here on a scientific basis. In 1990, the fine arts section was moved to a new building, located on Brâncuși Boulevard, near Gradina Publica (the former Ceausescu residence). This was named Constantin Brâncuși. In 1996, the history and archeology section of the Gorj County Museum was named after Alexandru Ștefulescu, the father of Gorj history.","County":"Gorj","Director":"Dumitru Hortopan","E-mail address":["muzeulgorjului@gmail.com"],"Fax":["0253.212.044"],"Founded":"1894","General profile":"History","Importance":"County","Locality":"Târgu Jiu","Main profile":"History","Museum code":"6938500","Name":"\"Alexandru Ștefulescu\" Gorj County Museum","Phone":["0253.212.044"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_16.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_17.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_18.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_19.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_20.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_21.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6938500_22.jpg"],"Postal code":"210136","Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2135\u0026-Casa-muzeu-„Maria-Lataretu”-Balcesti-Gorj","Museum code":"6938530","Name":"”Maria Lătărețu” Museum House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1693\u0026-Colectia-de-etnografie-„Casa-Cartianu”-Cartiu-Gorj","Museum code":"6938509","Name":"”Cartianu House” Ethnographic Collection"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d327\u0026-Muzeul-Arhitecturii-Populare-din-Gorj-Curtisoara-Gorj","Museum code":"6938503","Name":"Folk Architecture Museum of Gorj"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d321\u0026-Casa-Muzeu-„Constantin-Brancusi”-Hobita-Gorj","Museum code":"6938505","Name":"\"Constantine Brancusi\" House Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d331\u0026-Pestera-Polovragi-Polovragi-Gorj","Museum code":"7138400","Name":"Polovragi Cave"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2136\u0026-Muzeul-„Tudor-Arghezi”-Targu-Carbunesti-Gorj","Museum code":"6938540","Name":"”Tudor Arghezi” Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d322\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Ecaterina-Teodoroiu”-Targu-Jiu-Gorj","Museum code":"6938501","Name":"\"Ecaterina Teodoroiu\" Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d325\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-Targu-Jiu-Targu-Jiu-Gorj","Museum code":"6938506","Name":"Art Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2134\u0026-Muzeul-de-Istorie-si-Arheologie-„Alexandru-Stefulescu”-Targu-Jiu-Gorj","Museum code":"6938520","Name":"”Alexandru Ștefulescu” History and Archaeology Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d324\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Tudor-Vladimirescu”-Vladimir-Gorj","Museum code":"6938504","Name":"\"Tudor Vladimirescu\" Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d323\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Ion-Popescu-Voitesti”-Voitesti-Gorj","Museum code":"6938507","Name":"\"Ion Popescu Voitești\" Memorial House"}],"Time table":["Tuesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 17:00","Monday: closed"],"Website":["http://www.muzeugorj.ro/"]},{"Address":"Șoseaua București nr. 10","Administrative subordination":"Giurgiu County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d317\u0026-Muzeul-Judetean-„Teohari-Antonescu”-Sectia-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-Giurgiu","Collection(s)":"It holds valuable collections relating to the life, culture and folk art on the territory of Vlăsia and Burnas, the Danube River Meadow, Mostiștea Valley and Bărăgan Plain.

Materialele adunate au fost adăpostite într-o cameră a Liceului \"Ion Maiorescu\", prin bunăvoința directorului acestuia, Savin Popescu. Pe baza săpăturilor prof. Dumitru Berciu, prin anii \u002750 s-a înființat Muzeul Raional Giurgiu, în cadrul Regiunii București, pornit de un grup de entuziaști, între care Rădulescu și Mihai Ionescu. Muzeul a început cu o colecție de științele naturii, apoi a căpătat un profil mixt, adăugându-se colecții de artă și arheologie. După 1968, odată cu reorganizarea administrativă, a devenit muzeu județean pentru județul Ilfov. În ajunul centenarului Independenței, muzeul, găzduit până atunci într-o modestă casă, s-a mutat în fosta clădire a Prefecturii, el funcționând în continuare ca secție a Muzeului Județean Ilfov. După 1990 a revenit la vechea denumire, ca muzeu județean independent. Mai are în subordine muzeul de la Florești-Stoienești. Clădirea este monument istoric, sediul fostei Prefecturi de Vlașca. Un prim corp datează din sec. al XIX-lea (1877-1878), iar în 1903 se mărește și se modernizează. Valorifică expozițional și conservă piese de istorie; arheologie: material litic din paleolitic, ceramică și idoli din neolitic, din epoca bronzului și a fierului, unelte, ceramică, podoabe, monede (13 tezaure monetare, o colecție alcătuită din 2500 de piese din aur, argint și metal comun), arme, documente din evul mediu și din epoca modernă; etnografie. Se pot vizita 8 săli la parter, care cuprind 3 săli de istorie străveche și veche; se remarcă idoli neolitici, vase antropomorfe și zoomorfe de la Sultana (cultura Gumelnița), obiecte aparținând culturii Tei. Alte trei săli sunt dedicate istoriei medievale: colecția de proiectile de artilerie din Cetatea Giurgiului, ceramică cu sgrafitto. Sălile de istorie modernă prezintă perioada de la 1821 la Alexandru Ioan Cuza: steme în marmură de pe frontispiciul unor clădiri, colecție de hărți, inclusiv planul Cetății Giurgiu de la 1790, întocmit de austrieci, achiziție recentă; presă locală, istoria Șantierului naval din Giurgiu (centenar), colecție de peste 19.000 de periodice: colecția integrală \"Resboiul\", \"Fundațiile Regale\", \"Viața Românească\", \"Flacăra\", \"Furnica\" etc., pictură (Sava Henția, Vermont, Corneliu Baba, Basarab, Theo Sion, Știubei etc.), sculptură (Romanelli), grafică (Bulgăraș); colecție de monede antice, medievale și moderne; bibliotecă, carte veche.","County":"Giurgiu","Director":"Ionel Muscalu","E-mail address":["muzeuljudeteangiurgiu@gmail.com"],"Fax":["0246.212.804"],"Founded":"1934, 1977","General profile":"Archaeology","Historic Monument Building":"GR-II-m-B-14876","Importance":"County","Locality":"Giurgiu","Main profile":"Archaeology","Museum code":"6936500","Name":"\"Teohari Antonescu\" County Museum","Phone":["0246.216.801","0246.212.804"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6936500_10.jpg"],"Postal code":"080024","Social media":["https://www.facebook.com/muzeuljudeteanteohari.antonescugiurgiu/"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d317\u0026-Muzeul-Judetean-„Teohari-Antonescu”-Sectia-de-Etnografie-si-Arta-Populara-Giurgiu","Museum code":"6936502","Name":"\"Teohari Antonescu\" County Museum.

In 1974 the continuously growing collection was placed into a peasant house built at the beginning of the 20th century. In the next decade the collection was extended with objects from different ethnographic regions of Transylvania and Moldavia. The first exhibition was organized in 1993 with the title: \"Traditional Folk Art of Zăbala\". The first the permanent exhibion called \"The Traditional Folk Art of the Moldavian Csángós\" was opened on September 14. 2003, within a festive event. the professional inventory, administration and description of the collection was carried out step by step by the ethnography students of Babeș-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca. In 2004 Pro Museum Association was founded, the owner of the collections and the immovables. From 2005 the Museum is an external Department of the Sekler National Museum of Sfântu Gheorghe, Covasna County. In 2007 we started the accreditation process of the Museum and its inclusion into the national museal circuit of Romania. The exhibitions can be visited since 2003. The Csángó Ethnographical Museum - as a Department of the Sekler National Museum - received a preliminary notification of functioning in December 2007 from the Ministry of Culture, Cults and National Patrimony. The institution is supported by the Local Council of Zăbala, by Covasna County Council as well as by different cultural foundations. The most valuable part of this collection is represented by ceramic tiles. Among the 200 pieces we can find some from the 15th-19th century, manufactured under the influence of Rennaisance, Rococo and Classicism. The scientific research on the tiles found at Zăbala and deposited in the Museum produced several papers published in specific volumes. From the 200 pieces we managed to take stock and describe different bowls, jugs and other ceramics collected from the village and its surroundings. A part of these are the works of local craftsmen from the 18th-19th centuries, but we also have products from Corund, Mădăraș, Bârsănești, Satul Nou, Iara, Vadul Crișului, Rădăuți, Vama, Turda and Zalău. The Saxon collection of our museum was realized at the end of the 20th century, and it was exhibited in Tg. Mureș, Cluj-Napoca, Sf. Gheorghe, Sighișoara and Zăbala. It includes first of all traditional festive costumes, interior textiles, different pieces of furniture and ceramics, coming from the regions of Sibiu, Sighișoara, Țara Bârsei. With the help of these items we are able to represent the change within the Transylvanian Saxon culture and lifestyle during the 19th and 20th century. In addition to the collection of objects there is a rich photo and documentary material available. This collection of furniture represents the culture of peasant interiors from the 18th-19th-20th centuries. The most valuable items of this collection were manufactured in the 18th century. The most valuable dowry chests were painted in the 19th century. The collection hosts several pieces of furniture from the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, showing a strong influence of Secession. The interiors from the first part of the 20th century are the best documented ones, the collection containing complete pieces of furniture from several peasant houses. This collection consists of textiles related to family life, to interiors, to everyday and economic life. In the last few years we managed to collect several complete dowries from the interwar period. The Sekler costumes collected in the settlement expose a changing process from the beginning of the 20th century to our present days. Thus we can trace the evolution of the modernizing region\u0027s popular costume. The ethnographic collection of Zăbala contains numerous articles of personal and everyday use: containers, water jugs, salt cellars, hand mills, grain mortars, wood skates, hammer, grain shovel, umbrella, fire tong etc. The historic collection consists of objects related to the historic memory of the locals, different historic representations kept in private interiors. There are also objects related to WWI and WWII. We also have numerous objects, representations on the members of family Count Mikes, who had an important role in the social, economic, confessional, social and educational life of the village. The Romanian Collection of Zăbala presents first of all local interiors, different pieces of furniture, interior textiles, popular costumes from the beginning of the 20th century. We have documented the life style of a Romanian family from Zăbala through interviews, documentaries, photographs starting with 1974. This way we inherited the interiors of this family consisting of furniture, textiles, articles of personal use and festive costumes. As the major occupation of the local Romanians used to be sheperding, the present collection presents different objects related to animal keeping and milk processing in the Vrancea Mountains. The Romanian collection also contains interior textiles and traditional local costumes. We can enumerate popular costumes for men and women from the first part of the 20th century, shirts, cloaks, mantles etc. The interior textiles are represented by kerchiefs, pillowcases, bedspreads, carpets, curtains etc.Along with pieces of furniture, articles of everyday use, costumes and textiles, the Romanian collection includes objects of a memorial character: photographs, diplomas, icons etc. This collection also includes costumes, textiles, ceramics from other Romanian regions: Oaș, Făgăraș, Bistrița, Crișuri region, Banat, Sibiu, Vrancea, Bucovina. Csángó Collection was brought together by the founder of the Museum and by the results of the fieldwork carried out since 1991 by the researchers of Kriza János Ethnographical Society and the staff of the Department of Hungarian Ethnography and Anthropology of Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca. The collection presents mainly 20th century Csángó textiles, traditional interiors from Lespezi, Oituz Bacău, Pustiana, as well as the shop of potter Gabor Raymund. There are also everyday and festive costumes, furniture, musical instruments, objects and printings related to their religious life and articles of personal use, pottery from Oituz and Frumoasa. Most of the objects represent the essential moments in the sacred and the profane life of the Moldavian Csángós, from birth to death: for example there are objects related to customs, everyday life, religious life, costumes related to the rites of passage, the art of sewing, sacred objects (books, rosaries etc.), musical instruments, symbols of christening, wedding and funeral. The collection is documented with the help of an outstanding visual material. In the villages of Covasna County Gypsies are dealing with different traditional craftsmanship: burning of bricks, manufacturing of baskets and brooms, while in other settlements they are making bins of wood for grains or flower. We would like this crafstmanship diversity to be presented within our Museum especially by the products of the craftsmen from this region: tiles, brooms, baskets as well as the tools in use for the manufacturing of these.","Commune":"Zăbala","Contact person":"Dr. Kinda István","County":"Covasna","E-mail address":["csangomuzeum@gmail.com","petibotond@gmail.com"],"Founded":"2003","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Zăbala","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"6928514","Name":"Ethnographic Museum","Part of":"Székely National Museum","Phone":["0267.375.566"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6928514_08.jpg"],"Position":"Muzeograf-etnograf, responsabil secție","Postal code":"527195","Time table":["10:00 - 18:00"],"Website":["http://www.csangomuzeum.ro/romana"]},{"Access":"at the corner of Piața Libertății (Liberty Square)","Address":"Piața Libertății nr. 2","Administrative subordination":"Private Museum/Collection","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1877\u0026-Spatiul-expozitional-de-arta-contemporana-MAGMA-Sfantu-Gheorghe-Covasna","Collection(s)":"Starting with April 1st 2010, the Székely National Museum runs a gallery of contemporary art (the only one in Transylvania).

Remus Opreanu, primul prefect român din Dobrogea, și revizorul școlar Ion Bănescu adună vestigiile din Constanța și împrejurimi și le adăpostesc în clădirea Prefecturii. Micul muzeu s-a dezorganizat în 1882, din cauza unui incendiu. Monumentele salvate au fost adăpostite în \"pavilionul\" din grădina publică. După mai multe peregrinări, Muzeul de Istorie Națională și Arheologie a fost reorganizat în această formă completă în 1977. Clădirea muzeului a fost ridicată la începutul secolului al XX-lea, cu o arhitectură specific românească, pentru administrația locală. A fost cedată muzeului de către Primăria Constanța în 1977. Expune piese de arheologie preistorică, greacă, romană, bizantină și medievală: unelte de silex, ceramică, unelte și arme (din piatră, bronz și fier), elemente de arhitectură, artă sculpturală, vase de sticlă, microstatuaria din bronz, bijuterii; numismatică: monede de bronz, argint și aur, ca unicate fiind monedele scitice; istorie. În două săli amplasate la parterul muzeului sunt reunite monumentele arheologice cu valoare deosebită, rarități și unicate: colecția de statuete \"tip Tanagra\" (din epocile elenistică și romană timpurie); vase ceramice antropomorfe sau cu reprezentări dionisiace; tezaurul tomitan de sculpturi descoperit în 1962 (bustul zeiței Isis, aedicula cu dubla reprezentare a zeiței Nemesis, grupul statuar Fortuna cu Pontos, statuia Șarpelui Glicon etc.); colecția de portrete imperiale (Antonius Pius, Caracalla, Gordian III, Filip Arabul, Constantin); colecțiile de podoabe din aur (inele, cercei, brățări, pandantive, cruciulițe), geme și camee; tezaurul de vase din argint descoperit la Sucidava-Izvoarele. Etajul I al muzeului este amenajat cronologic - de la paleoltic până la evul mediu: colții de mamut de dimensiuni mari de la Poarta Albă, ceramică Hamangia; sabia miceniană de la Medgidia (secolul al XIV-lea a.Ch.) și depozitele de seceri, topoare și podoabe din bronz descoperite la N. Bălcescu, Constanța, Gura Dobrogei; statuia din calcar a unei căpetenii traco-scitice (descoperită la Sibioara) și un cazan de cult din bronz (găsit la Castelu), ambele din secolul al V-lea a.Ch.; colecția de amfore grecești și fragmente arhitectonice din marmură de la edificiile publice de epocă elenistică, descoperite la Tomis, Histria, Callatis; monumente epigrafice din cetatea de la Albești. Perioada romană este intens reprezentată prin materialele descoperite: documente epigrafice, cărămizi ștampilate, stâlpi miliari, elemente de arhitectură, unelte agricole, materiale ceramice diverse, între care se remarcă colecția de opaițe, sculptură laică, votivă și funerară - busturile unor cetățeni, un cadran solar, reprezentările divinităților Venus, Apollo, Hercule, Cybela, Cavalerul Trac, portretele și stelele funerare. Ultimele două săli ale etajului ilustrează desăvârșirea formării poporului român: locuință românească de secol X de la Capidava, reconstituită, obiecte de cult, precum și așezământul monahal de la Basarabi. Din perioada bizantină provin: colecția de monede schifate descoperite la Isaccea, ceramica, uneltele și podoabele descoperite la Gârlița, Capul Viilor (Histria), Castelu, Dinogeția etc. Pentru secolele XVII - XVIII sunt expuse arme, obiecte și carte de cult, podoabe, obiecte de uz casnic și vase ceramice smălțuite. Etajul III ilustrează epoca cuprinsă între perioada de destrămare a societății feudale până în 1940: obiecte tridimensionale, documente și fotografii originale, cărți, hărți, machete.","County":"Constanța","Director":"Aurel Mototolea","E-mail address":["minaconstanta@gmail.com"],"Fax":["0241.618.763"],"General profile":"Archaeology","Historic Monument Building":"CT-II-m-A-02831","Importance":"Regional","Locality":"Constanța","Main profile":"Archaeology","Museum code":"6926500","Name":"National History and Archaeology Museum","Phone":["0241.614.562","0341.408.739"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6926500_11.jpg"],"Position":"Director","Postal code":"900745","Social media":["https://www.facebook.com/minaconstanta"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d246\u0026-Complexul-muzeal-„Tropaeum-Traiani”-Adamclisi-Constanta","Museum code":"6926504","Name":"Museum Complex ”Tropaeum Traiani”"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1660\u0026-Muzeul-„Axiopolis”-Cernavoda-Constanta","Museum code":"51620000218","Name":"\"Axiopolis\" Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d239\u0026-Edificiul-Roman-cu-Mozaic-Constanta","Museum code":"6926501","Name":"Roman Agora Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1635\u0026-Muzeul-Carsium-Harsova-Constanta","Museum code":"51620000194","Name":"Carsium Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d225\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-Histria-Istria-Constanta","Museum code":"6926503","Name":"Histria Museum Complex"}],"Time table":["Wednesday - Sunday: 9:00 - 20:00 (summer) 9:00 - 17:00 (winter)","Monday, Tuesday: closed"],"Virtual tour":["http://www.cjc.ro/MINAC/ro/despre.html http://360.inp.org.ro/images/muzeu-constanta/tour.html"],"Website":["https://www.minac.ro"]},{"Address":"Strada Virgil Fulicea nr. 3","Administrative subordination":"Private Museum/Collection","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d2098\u0026-Muzeon-Muzeul-de-Istorie-a-Evreilor-Cluj-Napoca-Cluj","Collection(s)":"Muzeon is a complex encounter with the history of the Jewish people of Cluj.

The Society systematically acquired collections of antiquities, botany, zoology and mineralogy, coins and medals etc. In 1856, Count Emeric Mikó, a Transylvanian man of culture, donated his villa and park for establishing the museum, which, in 1860, was endowed with a library of its own. In 1872, all these collections were included in the heritage of the newly founded Cluj University. In 1929, the Institute for Classical Studies took over the antiquities collection. The museum opened to the public on the current premises in 1937, presenting to the visitors collections of antiquities, mediaeval and modern pottery, a mediaeval lapidarium, a painting gallery and an ethnographic collection. From 1948, the History Museum functioned within the Romanian Academy, the Cluj subsidiary, and in 1963, the museum became an independent institution. The museum is one of the most important in the country and owns large and important collections of archaeology - prehistoric, classical and mediaeval - history, coins and medals, clocks, lapidarium and others. Among them we mention the Uioara bronze hoard, Dacian pottery, iron tools and various finds discovered during the excavations of the Dacian fortresses from the Orăștie Mountains, the unique Dacian vessel bearing the inscription with the name of the most famous Dacian king \"Decebalus per Scorilo\", Roman inscriptions, funerary stones and sculptures; prints, engravings, mediaeval maps, weapons and documents from the Revolution of 1848.

Prima expoziție, organizată în trei încăperi, prezenta exponate legate de trecutul istoric îndepărtat, de începutul și dezvoltarea Uzinelor Reșița, ca și de cadrul natural din împrejurimi. Ca urmare a măririi colecțiilor, la începutul anului 1962 muzeului i s-a repartizat imobilul din str. 7 Noiembrie nr. 50. În 1968 Muzeul Orașului Reșița s-a transformat în Muzeul de Istorie al Județului Caraș-Severin. La sfârșitul lunii martie 1972 muzeului i-a fost atribuit un nou spațiu în clădirea din str. 7 Noiembrie nr. 8. Expoziția organizată cu prilejul inaugurării reprezenta dezvoltarea istorică a societății omenești de pe teritoriul județului Caraș-Severin din paleolitic și până în epoca contemporană. O altă expoziție ilustra dezvoltarea mineritului. După ce în primăvara anului 1977 a avut loc o încetare a activității muzeale, patrimoniul fiind depozitat într-un spațiu impropriu, în 1980 colecțiile au fost mutate în str. 6 Martie nr. 27, ocupând întreg etajul clădirii și câteva spații suplimentare în curte. În luna decembrie 1987 se face recepția noii clădiri a muzeului din B-dul Republicii nr.10, unde funcționează și în prezent.

Ca urmare, în 1895 se constituie prima colecție publică de piese arheologice, antropologice și istorice la Buzău, expusă în una din sălile Liceului \"Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu\". Putem considera acest moment ca reprezentând nașterea primului muzeu buzoian. Prima expoziție permanentă a muzeului (cu sediul în strada Unirii nr. 145) datează din anul 1955, când patrimoniul a fost constituit din piese preluate din colecțiile școlare și din materiale provenite din săpăturile arheologice de la Sărata Monteoru și Aldeni. Din februarie 1968 Muzeul orășenesc devine Muzeu județean. Din 1971 se elaborează o nouă tematică, valorificând mai ales patrimoniul muzeal de arheologie și istorie. Tot atunci se organizează primele depozite muzeale, după criterii științifice. În anul 1980 expoziția a fost mutată în actualul sediu, fiind inaugurată la 7 iulie 1981. A suferit transformări și reactualizări în 1986 și 1990. În anul 1980 s-au deschis Secția de pictură \"Brăduț Covaliu\" și Secția de artă decorativă, conținând valoroase piese de tapiserie, sculptură, sticlă. Secțiile de arheologie și istorie dețin valoroase piese aparținând aspectului cultural Stoicani-Aldeni, culturii Monteoru, plastică geto-dacică de tip Cârlomănești, replica tezaurului de la Pietroasele - \"Cloșca cu puii de aur\" - piese aparținând epocii romano-bizantine, culturilor Sântana de Mureș, Ipotești-Cândești, Dridu. Sunt reprezentate vestigiile rupestre din Munții Buzăului, inventare arheologice din săpăturile efectuate la cetăți feudale (Vintilă Vodă, Berca, Bradu), elemente arhitectonice medievale. Colecția numismatică cuprinde 10 tezaure monetare din aur, argint și metal comun.

It functioned in the former Ceaparu Inn, and since 1959 has been located in the present premises. In 1968 the permanent exhibition of the museum was structured into two departments: history and art. It underwent reorganization in 1985 so that it should illustrate the history of the county on a national level. The museum occupies a building representing an architectonic monument, built in 1870, that over the time had various destinations (hotel - restaurant, other public utilities). The building was badly damaged by the earthquake from May 1990 and was restored. The archaeology department presents its collections by sites, which offers two advantages: on the one hand, the visitor can look at all the vestiges of a community and can develop a full image upon its occupations and lifestyle; on the other hand, the evolutional process becomes more and more obvious, as one can notice the changes in all fields, from artefacts to spiritual life. One can remark the sites of Brǎilița, Lișcoteanca, Grǎdiștea, Însurǎței, Siliștea, where the multi-millenary historical evolution can be looked into. One can admire the vessels and figure depictions from the Neolithic, adornment and rank pieces from the Bronze Age, the inventory of the grave from Gǎvani, the workshop of a jeweller from Grǎdiștea, Roman glass vessels. The structure of the history department collections runs as follows: Romanian and foreign rare books; Romanian and foreign manuscripts and documents; Romanian and foreign numismatic items (seal rings, seal matrices, coins and banknotes, medals and booklets); Romanian and foreign decorations (orders and medals); military history items (uniforms, side and fire weapons); metrology items; clocks; sound recording and rendering devices; period photographs and glass negatives.

Ei puneau astfel în operă testamentul cultural al lui Iacob Mureșianu, oferind statului român, în vederea organizării unui muzeu, spațiul necesar (o clădire construită în secolul XVI în stil neoclasic, declarată monument istoric), o foarte valoroasă colecție de mobilier, pictură, sculptură și mai ales, o arhivă de o inestimabilă valoare culturală, numărând peste 25.000 de documente. Muzeul este consacrat memoriei mai multor membri ai acestei familii cu mari merite în viața culturală și politică a vremii lor. După ce a fost subordonat, o perioadă, Muzeului Județean de Istorie Brașov, începând din 1998 a devenit muzeu de sine stătător. Muzeul ilustrează în special viața și activitatea poetului Andrei Mureșianu, autorul imnului de stat al României, a publicistului Iacob Mureșianu (1812 - 1887), a fiului său Aurel Mureșianu (1847 - 1909), gazetar și publicist, continuatorul tatălui la conducerea \"Gazetei de Transilvania\", și a compozitorului Iacob Mureșianu jr. Cele patru încăperi ale muzeului cuprind exponate ce ilustrează viața culturală a Brașovului din a doua jumătate a secolului al XIX-lea. La intrarea în muzeu se află o sculptură în bronz reprezentându-l pe Iacob Mureșianu-tatăl. Colecția de artă decorativă și artă plastică cuprinde piese de mobilier Biedermayer aparținând familiei, tablouri aparținând pictoriței Elena Mureșianu prima pictoriță româncă din Brașov și sculpturi lucrate de Traian Mureșianu. Arhiva Mureșenilor este una dintre cele mai bogate și importante arhive de familie. Conducând timp de mai bine de o jumătate de secol un ziar politic, Mureșenii au corespondat cu toți fruntașii politici ai vremii lor, atât din Ardeal, cât și din celelălte provincii locuite de români. Pe lângă corespondența politică, în Arhiva Mureșenilor se găsesc - sporindu-i valoarea culturală - numeroase manuscrise ale Mureșenilor și ale corespondenților ziarelor conduse de ei. Muzeul deține și o colecție de instrumente muzicale. Iacob Mureșianu (1812-1887) format la școlile Blajului, transmitea generațiilor de intelectuali ai sec. al XIX-lea mesajul cărturarilor Școlii Ardelene, potrivit căruia cultura are rolul determinant în evoluția unei națiuni, Iacob Mureșianu venea la Brasov în 1837 pentru a fi cel dintâi profesor al unei școli pe care va reusi să o transforme în ceea ce a fost Liceul latino-german și pentru a-l ajuta pe George Barițiu să redacteze primul ziar politic al românilor ardeleni. Organizarea de școli a fost o preocupare permanentă, Iacob Mureșianu reușind să pună bazele mai multor școli primare și să creeze statutele și programele de studiu în vederea înființării unor facultăți de drept și agronomie în limba româna. În 1850 devine proprietarul absolut al \"Gazetei Transilvaniei\", prin intermediul căreia a dus o luptă aprigă pentru obținerea de drepturi civice și politice pentru conaționalii săi. În semn de apreciere a laborioasei sale activități pentru unitatea culturală a tuturor românilor, în 1877 este primit în Academia Română. Andrei Mureșianu (1816-1863) la absolvirea Facultății de Teologie din Blaj este adus la Brașov de vărul său, Iacob Mureșianu, pentru a lucra împreună la formarea Liceului latino-german și pentru a redacta revista \"Foaie pentru minte, inimă și literatură\". Poet al Revoluției de la 1848, în luna mai a acelui an compune poezia \"Un răsunet\" pentru care va alege o melodie foarte mult cântată în toate provincinciile românesti, \"Din sânul maicii mele\". Lua astfel naștere \"Desteaptă-te Române\", imnul Revoluției de la 1848 și actualul imn de stat al României. Dr. Aurel Mureșianu (1847-1909), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu doctor al Facultății de Drept din Viena, renunță la o strălucită carieră juridică în capitala imperiului pentru a prelua în 1878 conducerea \"Gazetei Transilvaniei\", devenind primul ziarist profesionist din Transilvania. Foarte activ în viata politică, se află printre fondatorii Partidului Național Român, făcând parte aproape în permanență din Comitetul Central al acestuia, \"Gazeta Transilvaniei\" devenind oficios al partidului. Este autorul unuia dintre cele două proiecte care au stat la baza Memorandului din 1892 și s-a numărat printre apărători în Procesul Memorandiștilor, militând pentru dreptul fiecărui cetățean de a se putea apăra în limba maternă. Iacob Mureșianu jr. (1857-1917), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu, după doi ani de studii la Politehnica din Viena renunță pentru a se consacra muzicii. Repurtează succese remarcabile în timpul studiilor la Viena și Leipzig, dar la absolvirea Conservatorului se întoarce în țară pentru a se achita de datoria pe care consideră că o are fiecare intelectual român față de neamul sau. Întreaga creație îl plasează printre clasicii muzicii culte românești. Elena Mureșianu (1864-1924), soția lui Aurel Mureșianu, studiază artele frumoase la Viena și München. A fost prima pictoriță româncă din Brașov. Lucrate în maniera academismului german, portretele Elenei Mureșianu au, pe lângă valoarea artistică, și o mare valoare documentară. Traian Mureșianu (1864-1901), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu, bariton la Opera din Viena a fost și un foarte talentat sculptor, desfășurându-și activitatea de artist plastic la Iași. Iuliu Mureșianu (1900-1956), fiul lui Iacob Mureșianu jr., continuă cu succes vocația muzicală a tatălui său, obținând în anul 1940 premiul George Enescu. În aceeași clădire este amenajat și muzeul memorial Gheorghe Dima ((1847-1925) cuprinzând obiecte, fotografii și documente aparținând compozitorului.","Contact person":"Ovidiu-Constantin Savu","County":"Brașov","Director":"Valer Rus","E-mail address":["casa_muresenilor@yahoo.com"],"Fax":["0268.477.864"],"Founded":"1968","General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"BV-II-m-B-11472","Importance":"County","Locality":"Brașov","Main profile":"Memorials, Historical Personalities","Museum code":"6914503","Name":"\"Mureșianu\u0027s House\" Museum","Phone":["0268.477.864"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6914503_14.jpg"],"Position":"Manager interimar","Postal code":"500025","Social media":["http://muzeulmuresenilor.ro/blog/"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1648\u0026-Casa-Memoriala-„Stefan-Baciu”-Brasov","Museum code":"51620000207","Name":"\"Ștefan Baciu\" Memorial House"}],"Time table":["Monday - Saturday 9:00 - 17:00","Sunday closed"],"Virtual tour":["https://my.matterport.com/show/?m\u003dZ35Eh9YsMaw"],"Website":["http://www.muzeulmuresenilor.ro/"]},{"Access":"Opposite the Town Hall and the Park","Accreditation":["O.M.C. nr. 3213/10.12.2019 Acreditare"],"Address":"Bulevardul Eroilor nr. 21","Administrative subordination":"Brașov County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d146\u0026-Muzeul-de-Arta-Brasov-Brasov","Collection(s)":"The museum was initially established in the Town Hall.

În 1940 este inaugurat primul muzeu memorial, înființat în casa reconstruită în 1934, pe temeliile casei părintești a poetului. Întrucât nu respecta structura originalului, această casă este și ea dărâmată și în 1979 se inaugurează o altă casă (construită pe temelia celei dărâmate în 1924). Până în 1991, Casa Memorială a fost sub egida Muzeului Județean Botoșani, din 1991 - 1992 sub tutela Inspectoratului pentru Cultură al Județului Botoșani. Din 1992 devine Memorialul Ipotești - Centrul Național de Studii \"Mihai Eminescu\". Memorialul Ipotești cuprinde mai multe obiective de interes muzeal și cultural: Casa Memorială, monument reconstruit în 1979, arh. Virgil Polizu și Constantin Dumitrescu; Bisericuța familiei Eminovici, atestată din 1838, având hramul \"Sf. Voievozi\"; Biserica satului, construită începând cu 1929 din inițiativa și cu contribuția lui Nicolae Iorga și Cezar Petrescu; Casa țărănească de epocă (actualmente muzeu etnografic), în stil moldovenesc, proprietate a ultimului deținător al moșiei Ipotești - doctorul Papadopol;Biblioteca Națională de Poezie \"Mihai Eminescu\"; Muzeul \"Mihai Eminescu\". Ultimele două obiective menționate au fost inaugurate în 15 ianuarie, respectiv 15 iunie 2000, în cadrul amplului program cultural \"2000 - Anul Eminescu\". Memorialul Ipotești dispune de un bogat patrimoniu muzeal și cultural, din care se cuvin menționate obiectele ce au aparținut familiei Eminovici (mobilier, porțelanuri, cristaluri, linguriță de argint cu monograma mamei poetului, sigiliul în aramă al doctorului Șerban Eminovici - fratele poetului) și vechile obiecte specifice gospodăriilor țărănești (expuse în muzeul etnografic). Un capitol aparte îl constituie fondul documentar al Bibliotecii, în care sunt incluse fotocopiile a 32 de manuscrise eminesciene, fotografii și scrisori autografe ale poetului, Veronicăi Micle, ale lui Titu Maiorescu și ale altor personalități culturale ale secolului al XIX-lea, ediții din opera lui Mihai Eminescu - de la ediția Maiorescu din 1833 și până în prezent. Se pot vizita și mormintele lui Gheorghe și Raluca Eminovici, părinții poetului și a doi dintre frații poetului, Iorgu și Nicu; în apropierea acestora se găsește și mormântul simbolic al poetului, construit în 1989 de arhitectul Doru Bantuș. Tot la Ipotești se găsește și bustul din bronz al poetului, operă aparținând sculptorului Gheorghe Anghel.","Commune":"Mihai Eminescu","Contact person":"Daniel Tupiluș - director adjunct (0729887510) / Cotinel Munteanu - șef birou muzeografie, conservare, restaurare și supraveghere (0755817888)","County":"Botoșani","Director":"Conf. univ. dr.

Clădirea originală, cu pereți din paiantă, a fost demolată în 1965. Clădirea actuală a suferit mai multe modificări în timp: acoperișul din tablă a fost înlocuit cu șindrilă, stâlpii din beton au fost înlocuiți cu stâlpi de lemn (1967 - 1975). În 1990 s-a realizat racordul la instalația termică și în 1993 s-a refăcut instalația electrică, cu ocazia renovării clădirii. \u0026#206;n primele două încăperi locuite de familia Iorga (1876 - 1880), s-a realizat o reconstituire de epocă. Holul oferă posibilitatea organizării unor expoziții foto-documentare cu caracter temporar. Colecția de bază conține piese cu valoare deosebită: camera de lucru cuprinde biblioteca (primele ediții ale operei istoricului), vitrine cu exponate originale: fotografii, scrisori, manuscrise, cărți cu dedicații autografe, obiecte cu valoare memorială: ceas de masă, vas ornamental vienez (a aparținut bunicului), tablouri de familie, manuscrise aparținând mamei (Zulnia Iorga). S-a reorganizat, de asemenea, camera copiilor (având ca bază documentară opera memorialistică). În 1967 a luat ființă Biblioteca documentară \"Nicolae Iorga\". Între 1967 - 1971 s-a constituit patrimoniul muzeal și s-a amenajat expoziția de bază (colaborator Frassin Munteanu - Râmnic, Vălenii de Munte). În 1971 s-a inaugurat expoziția permanentă, cu ocazia sărbătoririi centenarului nașterii savantului Nicolae Iorga (1871 - 1940). În 1977 devine secția Muzeului Județean de Istorie Botoșani. În 1990 expoziția de bază a fost reorganizată, ceremonia de inaugurare a avut loc pe 27 noiembrie 1990 la comemorarea semicentenarului morții lui Nicolae Iorga (consultant științific și autorul unor donații importante: dr.

The house, which belonged to the family of the lawyer Dr. Aurel Lazăr, is a true monument of Romanian history in that, on October 12, 1918, the text of the Declaration of National Independence of the Romanians from Transylvania, Banat, Crișana and Maramureș was drawn up here , a document of particular importance, which became, since its launch, the manifesto-programme of the political movement for the national liberation of the Romanians from Transylvania, a movement that culminated in their acquisition, on December 1, 1918, of full independence. The basic exhibition reconstructs the environment in which Aurel Lazar\u0027s family lived in the first half of the 20th century. The largest part of the collection was donated to the museum by Valentina Lazăr, Aurel Lazăr\u0027s daughter-in-law, the most representative pieces being: an eclectic-style living room composed of a table with carved oak legs, a sofa, two chairs with upholstered arms, two smaller chairs. An important piece of the collection is a black armchair, which, according to Mrs. Valentina Lazăr, belonged to the desk on which the Oradea Declaration of Independence was drawn up on October 12, 1918. The main theme of the exhibition is the participation of the Bihoreans in the Great Union at Alba Iulia on December 1, 1918, but also the events preceding and following this memorable date in Romanian history. Visitors are greeted by a \"time tunnel\" in which personalities and events related to the Bihor lands are presented, which speak about the Romanian nation and the idea of ​​national unity. Interactive maps, the credentials of those present at Alba Iulia, as well as original documents and objects from that period (military uniforms, flags and objects that belonged to Romanian soldiers) can be consulted within the exhibition.","Contact person":"Cornelia Romînașu","County":"Bihor","Director":"Gabriel-Florin Moisa","E-mail address":["contact@mtariicrisurilor.ro"],"Fax":["0259.479.918"],"Founded":"2008","General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"BH-IV-m-B-01253","Importance":"County","Locality":"Oradea","Main profile":"Memorials, Historical Personalities","Museum code":"6908502","Name":"\"Aurel Lazăr\" Memorial House","Part of":"Criș Land Museum Complex","Phone":["0259.442.112","0771.742.846"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908502_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908502_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908502_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908502_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908502_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908502_06.jpg"],"Position":"Muzeograf","Postal code":"410043","Time table":["Tuesday-Sunday: 10:00-18:00 (1st April -31st October)","9:00-17:00 (1st November-31st March)","Monday closed"],"Website":["https://mtariicrisurilor.ro/muzeul-memorial-aurel-lazar/"]},{"Access":"DN 1 (E-60)","Address":"Parcul Traian nr. 1","Administrative subordination":"Bihor County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d113\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Ady-Endre”-Oradea-Bihor","Collection(s)":"The inauguration of the \"Ady Endre\" Memorial Museum took place on May 26, 1955. In its organization, Oradean writer Tabéry Géza, one of Ady\u0027s former friends, played an important role. The museum is housed in the building of the former \"Müller\" cafe, particularly popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The original construction, completed in 1869 in the square in front of the Bihor Prefecture headquarters, acquired its current form during the reconstruction in 1895. This charming local with a terrace was a favorite place of the young Hungarian poet Ady, not only to spend, according to the customs of the time, but also to work. According to tradition, in the summer season, in the right corner of the terrace was his table, where he wrote many of his reports and articles. In the current exhibition, inaugurated in 2003, the focus falls on the presentation of Ady\u0027s life and activity in Oradea, recreating, in the two side rooms, the atmosphere of the newsrooms and cafes of those times. The bilingual exhibition (Romanian and Hungarian) consists of three rooms. The large room, in the middle, presents the events in Oradea that were decisive for the poet\u0027s future. On the left wall at the entrance, the establishment, history and representatives of the A Holnap Literary Society are presented, and on the right wall we can take a look at the love story between Ady and Léda, a love that completely changed the poet\u0027s destiny. A shorter theme is Ady\u0027s relationship with the visual arts, and finally, on the last wall, the one on the right at the entrance, this part is concluded with a short biography of the poet. In the smaller room, on the left, the atmosphere of a newsroom is reconstructed with the help of enlarged pages and articles from the newspapers of the time. On display here is a desk, where, according to legend, Ady worked when he wrote for Nagyváradi Napló, and a vintage wall telephone (reconstruction) from the beginning of the 20th century, which can be used to listen to recordings made with Ady\u0027s friends. In the other smaller room, a vintage cafe is set up with round tables, chairs, mirrors, etc.","Contact person":"Szamos Mariann","County":"Bihor","Director":"Gabriel-Florin Moisa","E-mail address":["contact@mtariicrisurilor.ro"],"Fax":["0259.479.918"],"Founded":"1955","General profile":"Memorials","Historic Monument Building":"BH-IV-m-B-01256","Importance":"County","Locality":"Oradea","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"6908501","Name":"\"Ady Endre\" Memorial Museum","Part of":"Criș Land Museum Complex","Phone":["0771.742.846"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908501_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908501_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908501_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908501_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908501_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908501_06.jpg"],"Position":"Muzeograf","Postal code":"410033","Time table":["Tuesday-Sunday: 10:00-18:00 (1st April -31st October)","9:00-17:00 (1st November-31st March)","Monday closed"],"Website":["http://www.mtariicrisurilor.ro"]},{"Accreditation":["O.M.C. nr. 2900/05.05.2022 Acreditare"],"Address":"Strada Armatei Române nr. 1/A","Administrative subordination":"Bihor County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d114\u0026-Muzeul-Tarii-Crisurilor-Oradea-Complex-Muzeal-Oradea-Bihor","Collection(s)":"Anul 1872 a însemnat începutul activității Societății de Arheologie și Istorie a Comitatului Bihor și a orașului Oradea, precursoarea instituției muzeale orădene, care și-a propus, printre altele, și crearea unui muzeu al Bihorului. În 1896 are loc inaugurarea primei clădiri destinate unei instituții muzeale a locului, în prezent sediul Palatului Copiilor și Elevilor. Din păcate, aproape pe întreaga durată a primei conflagrații mondiale muzeul va fi închis. După 1 Decembrie 1918 muzeul a rămas în posesia Societății de arheologie și istorie a comitatului Bihor și a orașului Oradea, dar a primit un sprijin substanțial din partea statului român. În 1921 muzeul se va redeschide pentru public, iar în anul 1948 va trece în proprietatea statului. Între 1950-1970 a funcționat sub denumirile: Muzeul Petőfi-Bălcescu, Muzeul Regional Oradea, Muzeul Regional Crișana. În această perioadă au fost inaugurate două muzee memoriale: în anul 1955 Muzeul Memorial ,,Ady Endre”, iar în 1964 Muzeul Memorial ,,Iosif Vulcan”. La 17 ianuarie 1971 și-a deschis porțile Muzeul Țării Crișurilor în Palatul Baroc. Ca urmare a retrocedării acestei clădiri către Episcopia Romano-Catolică, în 2005, Muzeul Țării Crișurilor a dobândit un nou sediu, clădirea principală a Garnizoanei Oradea, aflată în Calea Armatei Române nr. 1/A. Odată cu mutarea muzeului în noul sediu, în 2017 s-a înființat și amenajat un Vivariu cu două săli expoziționale permanente, inaugurat în 2018, ce prezintă o colecție de animale vii, majoritatea exotice, în mediul lor de viață reconstituit. În anul 2018, întregul patrimoniu al muzeului a fost mutat în această clădire, care a devenit cel de-al treilea său sediu. În același an și-a schimbat și titulatura, devenind Muzeul Țării Crișurilor Oradea - Complex Muzeal. În cadrul acestuia funcționează și Muzeul Memorial ,,Aurel Lazăr, inaugurat la 1 decembrie 2008, iar din 2021 și Muzeul Orașului Oradea. În 2022 a fost finalizată expoziția permanentă a muzeului, structurată pe domeniile științele naturii, istorie, artă, etnografie. Colecțiile acestuia au continuat să se îmbogățească de-a lungul anilor, prin donații, achiziții și săpături arheologice, astfel că în prezent deține peste 550.000 de obiecte muzeale. Colecțiile de științe ale naturii sunt structurate pe două domenii mari: paleontologia și evoluția geologică a zonei de vest a României, remarcându-se vertebratele marine triasice, plantele fosile din Jurasicul inferior, dinozaurii din Cretacic și vertebratele din Pleistocen; al doilea domeniu este cel de biologie, cu colecții de botanică și zoologie, dintre care merită atenție colecția malacologică și cea oologică. Din colecția de arheologie menționăm cele peste 60 de piese antice egiptene, precum și valoroasele vase antice grecești pictate. Colecția de arheologie cuprinde și un bogat lapidariu medieval provenind în principal din Cetatea Oradea, pe lângă cahle, podoabe, unelte de fier, piese de bronz, ceramică, arme etc. Colecția numismatică a muzeului reflectă, prin tezaurele monetare și descoperirile izolate, circulația monedelor în Crișana, cu precădere în arealul actualului județ Bihor; perioadei antice îi revin tezaurele descoperite în localitățile Șilindia, Feniș, Almaș (jud. Arad) și Sânnicolau Român (jud. Bihor), formate din monede atribuite atelierelor celtice și dacice, cărora li adaugă câteva tezaure formate din drahmele orașelor adriatice (Dyrrhachium și Apollonia) și denari romani republicani - amintim descoperirile de la Dieci (jud. Arad), Tășad, Sacalasău Nou sau Drăgești (jud. Bihor). Colecția de documente conține acte emise de oficialitățile statului, de instituții de învățământ și de cultură, de instituții bancare, de întreprinderi economice, dar și de persoane particulare, cu o valoare deosebită pentru reconstituirea istoriei medievale, moderne și contemporane a acestui spațiu geografic. Colecția de artă universală cuprinde opere valoroase din secolele XV-XIX ale unor artiști renumiți din școlile flamandă, germană, austriacă, italiană, precum: Federico Barocci, Adam Elsheimer, Școala lui Franz Snyders, Peter Veredaelf, Pietro Marchesini, Hans Canon, Carl Moll, Peter Herwegen. Dintre artiștii ale căror lucrări le deținem în colecția de pictură românească se pot menționa: Gheorghe Petrașcu, Theodor Pallady, Nicolae Tonitza, Francisc Șirato, Camil Ressu, Iosif Iser, Jean Steriadi, Aurel Popp, Lucian Grigorescu, Hans Mattis-Teutsc, Corneliu Baba, Alexandru Ciucurencu, Ion Țuculescu, Magdalena Rădulescu, Horia Damian, Ion Gheorghiu, Horia Bernea. Importantă este și colecția de grafică veche-cabinetul de stampe, printre numele care semnează gravurile amintim pe Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach cel Bătrân, Marcantonio Raimondi, Hans Schaufelin, Hieronimus Coch ș.a. În cadrul colecțiilor de etnografie se remarcă cea de ceramică, alcătuită preponderent din vase cu caracter utilitar realizate în centre de olărit din Crișana (Criștiorul de Jos, Leheceni, Lelești, Săliște de Vașcău, Cărpinet, Salonta, Marghita, Vadu Crișului, Borod, Bârsa, Hălmăgel, Târnăvița); cea de port popular, inclusiv podoabe țărănești, din diverse zone și subzone etnografice din Țara Crișurilor; cea de lemn și metal, alcătuită din piese de mobilier țărănesc, precum și o mare gamă de obiecte de uz gospodăresc; cea de obiecte cultice, ce cuprinde icoane pe sticlă, icoane pe lemn și ouă încondeiate, care provin din centre importante de iconari, preponderent din Transilvania (Nicula, Scheii Brașovului, Făgăraș etc.); cea de textile, unde regăsim atât piese cu rol decorativ, cât și utilitar, folosite pe scară largă în locuința țărănească din trecut (șterguri, fețe de masa, lipidee, ponevi, țoluri etc.). Biblioteca deține 45.000 de volume.","Contact person":"Florina Ciure","County":"Bihor","Director":"Gabriel-Florin Moisa","E-mail address":["contact@mtariicrisurilor.ro"],"Fax":["0259.479.918"],"Founded":"1971","General profile":"Mixed","Importance":"Regional","Locality":"Oradea","Main profile":"History, Arts, Ethnography, Natural Sciences","Museum code":"6908500","Name":"Criș Land Museum Complex","Phone":["0259.706.101","0771.740.400"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_09.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_10.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_11.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_12.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_13.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_14.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_15.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_16.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_17.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_18.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_19.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_20.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_21.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_22.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_23.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_24.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_25.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_26.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_27.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6908500_28.jpg"],"Position":"Șef Serviciu Istorie","Postal code":"410087","Social media":["https://www.facebook.com/MuzeulTariiCrisurilor/","https://www.instagram.com/muzeultariicrisurilor/"],"Subordinate units.":[{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d113\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Ady-Endre”-Oradea-Bihor","Museum code":"6908501","Name":"\"Ady Endre\" Memorial Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1706\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Aurel-Lazar”-Oradea-Bihor","Museum code":"6908502","Name":"\"Aurel Lazăr\" Memorial House"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d117\u0026-Muzeul-Memorial-„Iosif-Vulcan”-Oradea-Bihor","Museum code":"69085020","Name":"\"Iosif Vulcan\" Memorial Museum"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1683\u0026-Muzeul-Orasului-Oradea-Oradea-Bihor","Museum code":"6908505","Name":"Museum of Oradea City"},{"CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d123\u0026-Pestera-Vadu-Crisului-Vadu-Crisului-Bihor","Museum code":"7109900","Name":"Vadu Crișului Cave"}],"Time table":["Tuesday-Sunday: 10:00-18:00 (1st April -31st October)","9:00-17:00 (1st November-31st March)","Monday closed"],"Website":["http://www.mtariicrisurilor.ro"]},{"Access":"In the Main Square, near Saint Nicholas Church","Address":"Strada Popa Șapcă nr. 3","Administrative subordination":"Bacău County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d112\u0026-Vivariul-Bacau-Bacau","Collection(s)":"The Vivarium was opened in 1976 in a building which was later demolished.

Personalitate bine cunoscută în cercurile culturale arădene, Iosif Sârbuț s-a născut în 1912, într-o familie de români de lângă localitatea maghiară Gyula. Nu a avut studii de specialitate, fiind angajat la Teatrul din Arad, încă din anul 1930, în calitate de mașinist de scenă, funcție pe care a deținut-o până la pensionare. Pasionat de istoria culturală arădeană, a colecționat vreme de decenii, mii de materiale muzeale din toate domeniile culturii, dar cu predilecție cele de natură teatrală. La un moment dat conducerea Teatrului de Stat din Arad i-a oferit patru camere în incinta instituției, în care Iosif Sârbuț a organizat și condus un Muzeu al Teatrului din Arad. În 1976, aceeași conducere a desființat compartimentul muzeal ceea ce l-a convins pe colecționar să doneze colecția Muzeului Județean Arad.În 1986, colecția a fost mutată în depozitul de lângă sala \"Clio\". În perioada 1990 - 2000, au fost organizate opt expoziții temporare cu piese din colecție. Colecția se află într-un depozit amenajat în incinta clădirii de pe str. Gh. Popa de Teiuș nr. 2 - 4. Construită în 1909 ca sediu administrativ, ea a fost transformată, în 1984, în sediul secției de artă a Complexului Muzeal Arad, adăpostind, în același timp, biblioteca județeană și sala de expoziții temporare a muzeului (sala \"Clio\"). Atât sala \"Clio\", cât și depozitul (situat lângă aceasta) au fost renovate radical în 2004. Colecția cuprinde peste 25.000 piese datând din secolele XIX - XX: afișe originale în diverse formate, plachete-invitații, cataloage, cărți de teatru, reviste teatrale, muzicale și cinematografice din Arad, fotografii cu artiști ai teatrului și din spectacole, partituri muzicale manuscrise sau tipărite, diverse obiecte de recuzită teatrală, instrumente muzicale, tablouri-portrete ale unor personalități culturale arădene, costume din spectacole, aparate pre-cinematografice și cinematografice etc. Dintre acestea sunt de menționat: statutul, regulamentul de funcționare și programa de studiu a Conservatorium-lui din Arad (1833 - a șasea instituție de acest tip din Europa); afișe ale unor spectacole jucate pe scena Teatrului Vechi din Arad (1817 - primul teatru de pe actualul teritoriu al României) în perioada 1833 - 1871, dintre care se remarcă cele ale unor trupe austriece, maghiare și românești (M. Pascaly - 1868, M. Millo - 1870/71); placheta-afiș a filmului Războiul de Independență (1913 - realizat de Grigore Brezeanu), film proiectat la cinematograful Urania, amenajat în 1907 în clădirea Teatrului Vechi; filme pe celuloid realizate la Arad în 1913 (Nunta pe Strada Mare; Răzbunarea lui Napoleon); pianul la care a concertat Franz Liszt la Arad (1846) și donat de către compozitor Conservatorium-ului (pianul este expus în foaierul Palatului Cultural).","Contact person":"Alina Mladin","County":"Arad","Director":"Dr. Sorin Bulboacă","E-mail address":["office@museumarad.ro"],"Founded":"1960","General profile":"History","Importance":"County","Locality":"Arad","Main profile":"History","Museum code":"6902501","Name":"\"Iosif Sârbuț\" Theatre, Music and Cinema History Collection","Part of":"Arad Museum Complex","Phone":["0257.281.847","0721.218.569"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6902501_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6902501_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6902501_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6902501_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6902501_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6902501_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/6902501_07.jpg"],"Position":"Restaurator","Postal code":"310131","Time table":["On demand, just for study."],"Website":["http://www.museumarad.ro"]},{"Access":"CFR: Arad; DN 7 road","Address":"Piața George Enescu nr. 1","Administrative subordination":"Arad County Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d71\u0026-Complexul-Muzeal-Arad-Arad","Collection(s)":"The museum building is the Culture Palace, a monument of architecture from 1913, by the architect Ludovic Szantay.

Sala Unirii a fost construită între 1898 - 1900, având inițial destinația de cazinou militar. A fost restaurată în 1922 și între 1967 - 1968. Este clădirea unde s-a votat Unirea Transilvaniei cu România. Muzeul din Alba Iulia a fost inaugurat în 1888 din inițiativa Societății de istorie, arheologie și științele naturii din Comitatul Alba Inferioară, avându-l ca director pe renumitul arheolog Adalbert Cserny (1842 - 1916). În 1929, sub egida ASTREI, a fost organizat ca Muzeu al Unirii. Bogatelor colecții arheologice li s-au adăugat piese valoroase referitoare la istoria modernă a românilor. În 1938, sub conducerea istoricului Ion Berciu, sub noua denumire de Muzeul Regional Alba Iulia, așezământul a intrat în administrația statului român. A cunoscut o amplă reorganizare în 1968, revenind la numele de Muzeul Unirii. În linii mari, forma actuală a expoziției de bază datează din 1975. În 1992 a devenit Muzeul Național al Unirii subordonat direct Ministerului Culturii. Muzeul prezintă publicului arheologie: preistorică (ceramică, unelte și arme din piatră, bronz, fier), dacică - provenind de la cetățile dacice Craiva, Cugir și Căpâlna (ceramică, monumente, unelte, arme și podoabe din fier, bronz, argint), romană - provenind din marele centru urban Apulum (monumente epigrafice, sculpturale, gliptică, numismatică, vase ceramice, lucerne, unelte și arme din fier, obiecte de podoabă), medievală (ceramică, bijuterii și obiecte din aur, argint și bronz din secolele VIII - X din necropolele dezvelite la Alba Iulia, Blandiana și Ghirbom, cahle, arme, sigilii nobiliare și ale orașului Alba Iulia); istorie (documente, fotografii și obiecte memoriale legate de Revoluția de la 1848, Memorandum, Unirea de la 1 Decembrie 1918); periodice - cărți; colecții de etnografie și artă populară (port, țesături, ceramică, icoane pe lemn și sticlă, obiecte din metal și lemn); numismatică (antică, medievală și modernă); bibliotecă (55.000 volume).","Contact

Currently the objects pertaining to the national cultural heritage are preserved in the museum of the monastery housed in a building built for this specific purpose. The museum is located in the south-east precinct of the monastery, near the bell tower. The architectural design is based on the value of the architectural tradition specific of the historical Maramureș area and integration into the site. The museum is a building structured on three levels: basement, ground floor and first floor. The basement and ground floor are built on a structure of brick walls and reinforced concrete pits, and the floor is made of wood. The interior is dominated by a free space throughout the building height. The project is designed to provide display room for icons and display windows with old books, on the ground floor, and workshops where the nuns perform the art of weaving, of painting icons on various supports, in the basement, and upstairs there are the ethnographic exhibits. Upstairs the spaces for exhibits are linked by a corridor of the tent type. All these spaces are designed to create the image of a Maramureș homestead, as the carpentry and furniture are inspired by the local style. There is also a place for rest and meditation, the pavilion, an element characteristic of Romanian architecture. The first floor and basement can be reached through two symmetrical staircases so one can go around for a visit.

The ”Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University Museum functioned since 1985 within the Rector’s Office. Thanks to Octav Davideanu, former chief-secretary of the University, many objects valuable for the academic life were preserved, though not all of them became available for the public. A significant part of documentary patrimony and objects remained in several personal archives, while a series of exhibits and documents were fragmented and given in the custody of some institutions, such as Petru Poni Museum, The Museum of the Union, State Archives etc. Some of them have been recovered in recent years through donations and purchases, along with getting in custody. The current location of the institution offers the academic collection a generous space, organized both by thematic criteria and in relation to various historical stages of the higher education in Iasi. Thus, a Rector’s Office is presented, with proper furniture, the first academic medals, various seals and some of the university symbols, namely the silver hammer and trowel used on May, 23rd 1893 at the solemnity of settling the fundamental stone of the University Palace in Copou. A substantial area is allotted to the historical evolution of the institution, as its official opening and the anniversaries of 1910/1911, 1960, 1985 and 2010 are reminded of by representative exhibits (the flags of the first universities, pictures of important figures, official documents, medals, photos, publications). Most part of the academic collection presents the evolution of disciplines, aiming to illustrate the achievements in knowledge and scientific carrier of important figures. Various laboratories, the Museum of Natural History, the Botanical Garden and the University Central Library are properly presented, thus revealing the importance in the research plan of each of these components of academic space. A special attention is paid to former students of the university, who are depicted in terms of activities developed both in formal space and out of it. International relations of the oldest Romanian university are outlined in a separate frame. In addition to furniture, meant to create an academic feeling, the atmosphere is audio-visually backed up by Romanian and English films about the history of the institution. The Cucuteni Civilization Museum: In 1916, through the efforts of Orest Tafrali, the first entity for preserving the antiques belonging to the heritage of the “Alexandru Ion Cuza” University of Iasi from archeological excavations at Cucuteni culture was founded. After World War Second these objects entered the custody of the History Museum of Moldavia, an institution subordinated to the Ministry of Culture. During the postwar period, the research undertaken by archeologists from the Faculty of History and the Institute of Archeology of Iasi, namely Radu Vulpe, Mircea Petrescu-Dîmbovița, Marin Dinu, Attila László, Dan Monah, Nicolae Ursulescu and Vasile Cotiugă led to the founding of a new collection, representative for material life and spiritual manifestations that made this ancient civilization known. Some of the most valuable pieces, revealed by several archaeological diggings, and exhibits from the Collection of Cucuteni for the 3rd Millennium Foundation are now brought together in the “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University Museum. The area dedicated to Cucuteni civilization is organized in a modern manner, so that images depicting scenes of daily life are illustrated by original exhibits. The central room introduces guests to the fascinating domain of archaeological research through a major reconstruction, which shows various stages of exploration, from archaeological diggings to restoration of pieces revealed. The entire space presenting the Cucuteni civilization emphasizes creations belonging to ancient people, which are organized in the exhibition area according to their specificity. Thus, the visitors first enter the art room, with famous spiral motif vessels, painted in red, black and white, then the trades room, with various tools and weapons and a dwelling specific to the epoch, and end the tour in the treasure room, with priceless exhibits, such us ornaments and objects of worship. This latter area bears a special feeling, due to the winding form of clay walls and the ceiling playing for the starry sky under which the inhabitants of this part of Europe formed a civilization 7000 years ago. A great audio-video material rounds out the original manner of organizing this area, by presenting the results of archaeological research, particularly the experimental ones, so that the entire assembly depicts, in an authentic manner, a fragment of the past.","County":"Iași","Director":"Conf. univ. dr.

Their relics and works are exhibited in the Bolyai Memorial Museum founded in 1937, in a room of the Protestant College Library. In 1955, the museum and the college library, home to 20,000 pages of manuscripts by the two Bolyais, were moved to the building of the Teleki Library. At the beginning, the Bolyai Memorial Museum belonged to the Protestant College Library (i.e. the Bolyai Library), which later merged with the Teleki Library and is today the Teleki-Bolyai Library. The museum has always been managed by the librarians. Bolyai Farkas (1775-1856) was born in the village of Bólya, Szeben County on 9 February, 1775. The family belonged to the nobility, but by the time Farkas was born they were no longer wealthy. He started his schools at the Nagyenyed Protestant College. He was considered a prodigy due to his talent in mathematics and languages. Later he transferred to the Kolozsvár Protestant College. He developed a passion for mathematics at the University of Göttingen. This is where he became a life-long friend of the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. When he returned home, he settled in Kolozsvár. He performed his inaugural address at the Marosvásárhely Protestant College on 4 May, 1804. For the next 47 years, he was professor of mathematics, physics, chemistry and astronomy at the college that today bears his name. His life work is of an extraordinary diversity; however, he was most outstanding as a mathematician. His first works treat the parallel axiom. His masterpiece, the Tentamen (Marosvásárhely, 1832) contains his reflections on the foundations of mathematics, a number of innovative thoughts ahead of his time. He originally intended his books on mathematics as textbooks. He was an outstanding theoretical pedagogue; he wrote several works calling for changes in public education. Some of the points he argued for were a more cleverly organized curriculum and practical education. Bolyai János (1802-1860) was one of the greatest personalities in the history of mathematics. He broke new grounds in science: the creation of Non-Euclidian geometry revolutionized geometry and the theory of physics and replaced Newtonian theories about the world. He was born in Kolozsvár, on 15 December, 1802. He was brought up in Marosvásárhely and attended the Protestant College. He showed a great interest in mathematics as a child. However, due to the limited financial possibilities of the family he couldn’t attend the University of Göttingen; instead, he went to the Military Academy of Vienna. The military career was a burden to him. He entered the army engineering corps and was sent to Temesvár, Arad and then to Olmütz; then, at the age of 30, he retired and moved home to Marosvásárhely. He lived a retiring life here and on his estate in Domáld, which the family had inherited from Farkas Bolyai’s mother. From a young age, János Bolyai was interested by the unsolved problems of mathematics, most of all the 9th axiom of Euclid, the Postulate of the Parallels. With hard work, he developed Non-Euclidian Geometry as early as in 1823. He wrote down his findings in his work entitled Scientia Spatii, which was only published in 1832, as an appendix to his father’s book Tentamen. One of the greatest achievements of the age, it still didn’t bring any change in Bolyai’s life. His name remained unknown for the world of science.","County":"Mureș","Founded":"1937","General profile":"Memorials","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Târgu Mureș","Main profile":"Memorials","Museum code":"802035","Name":"Bolyai Museum","Phone":["0265.261.857"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/802035_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/802035_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/802035_03.jpg"],"Postal code":"540067","Time table":["9:00 - 17:00"],"Website":["http://telekiteka.ro/index.php?lang\u003dro"]},{"Access":"Alba Carolina Citadel","Address":"Strada Gabriel Bethlen nr. 1","Administrative subordination":"Romania National Library","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d751\u0026-Colectia-muzeala-a-Bibliotecii-Batthyaneum-Alba-Iulia-Alba","Collection(s)":"Biblioteca a luat ființă în 31 iulie 1798, din inițiativa episcopului romano-catolic al Transilvaniei Batthyani Ignac (1741-1798) în cadrul unei fundații culturale, în componența acesteia intrau un observator astronomic, colecții de istorie și de științe naturale, o legătorie și o tipografie.

She has been living in this town all her life. Her father and grandfather were tailors who specialized in Szekely clothes. She was familiar from early childhood with the Szekler folk costumes of Madaras-Ciuc. She also got to know the folk costumes from neighboring villages. Over the years she noted that the traditional costume from her village is changing, shifting and evening out. Traditional garb was colorful in the past. Women and girls wore different Szekely clothes according to their age. This changed and became standardized. Slowly, the old garments remained in closets or were sold. Interestingly, in the neighboring villages this change was happening at a slower pace. Her objective was to preserve traditional garb, so she started collecting garments from the past, skirts, aprons, photographs of the past and any objects that were costume related. She has sown 37 small folk costumes for dolls. Of these, 6 costumes now reside at the Ethnographic Museum in Keszthely in Hungary. The exhibition includes numerous original or recreated costumes, a collection of postcards and a collection of 800 old photos. The space allotted for the collection is not very big, but it fits the owner\u0027s vision for the exhibition. During her activity she took down information regarding Seckler costumes and our habits, which resulted in four books (2008, Customs and traditions of Mădăraș; 2009, Past and present Seckler costumes, wearing Seckler costumes at various events in the Madaras Ciuc village; 2010, Important families and talented people from Mădăraș).","Commune":"Mădăraș","County":"Harghita","Director":"Tankó-Molnár Mária-Terézia","E-mail address":["maria.tanko@freemail.hu"],"Founded":"2005","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Mădăraș","Main profile":"Ethnography, history","Museum code":"650870","Name":"Museum Collection","Phone":["0747.246.657","0266.335.705"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_04.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_05.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_06.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_07.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_08.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650870_09.jpg"],"Postal code":"537071","Time table":["10:00-17:00 (prior reservation for groups)"]},{"Address":"Strada Vasile Lascar nr. 26-28, sector 2","Administrative subordination":"Local Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1848\u0026-Colectie-muzeala-a-aromanilor-Bucuresti","Collection(s)":"It presents an interesting collection of significant cultural objects from the Aromanian history and traditions.

In a wooden house with traditional architecture in their backyard, they arranged a museum with objects collected only from Momârlani villages, many of rare beauty. Determined to fight for the preservation of traditions still alive, they founded an association in 2009 and organize Nedeia on the holiday of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, Christmas traditions and festivals that gather together hundreds of local inhabitants, leading old habits in the future.","Contact person":"Elena Mălinesc și Petru Gălățan","County":"Hunedoara","E-mail address":["bujoriidemunte@gmail.com"],"Founded":"2005","General profile":"Ethnography","Importance":"Local","Locality":"Petroșani","Main profile":"Ethnography","Museum code":"650520","Name":"The \"Momârlani\" Ethnographic Museum","Phone":["0723.290.175","0730.163.920"],"Pictures":["https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650520_01.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650520_02.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650520_03.jpg","https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/P/Ghid/650520_04.jpg"],"Position":"Proprietari","Postal code":"332054","Time table":["On demand"]},{"Access":"200 m from the centre of the village","Administrative subordination":"Local Council","CIMEC URI":"https://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/idEN.asp?k\u003d1842\u0026-Colectia-de-obiecte-etnografice-„Karda-Karoly”-Carta-Harghita","Collection(s)":"The owner has a collection of about two hundred ethnographic objects, especially wooden objects and tools (for agriculture and husbandry), as well as furniture and a few of old manuscripts.
